<p>Death is no more!</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.</p>
<p>One of the most important facets of salvation is Christ trampling death by His death. The reason Christians in the New Testament do not fear death, it is because in Christ death is no more. We simply depart from this world to go into the other one to enjoy unity with the Holy Trinity. This was made possible by Christ being Victor over death through the cross when He tasted death and killed it in the process. One of the reasons that Christ took on a full humanity is to be able to die to kill death itself (God Himself in His Divinity cannot die).</p>
