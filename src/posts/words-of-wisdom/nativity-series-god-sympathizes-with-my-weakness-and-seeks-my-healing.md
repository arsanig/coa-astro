<p>God Sympathizes with my weakness and seeks my healing.</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.</p>
<p>Another facet of salvation is the healing or recreation of humanity. St. Athanasius in, On the incarnation, says the following: “…for the first fact that you must grasp is this: the renewal of creation has been wrought by the Self-same Word Who made it in the beginning. There is thus no inconsistency between creation and salvation…” (St. Athanasius, On the Incarnation, Par. 1)</p>
