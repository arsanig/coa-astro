<p>Nativity Series &#8211; Christ is baptized for my sake</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.</p>
<p>St. Cyril of Alexandria, the pillar of faith, says that following: â€œBut how then, they object, was he baptized and received the Spirit? We reply that he had no need of holy baptism. He was wholly pure and spotless, and the holiest of the holy. He did not need the Holy Spirit, for the Spirit that proceeds from God the Father is from him and equal to him in substance</p>
