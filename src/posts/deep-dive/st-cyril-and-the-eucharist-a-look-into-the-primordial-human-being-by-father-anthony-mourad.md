<p>In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit one God Amen</p>
<p>Deep dive into the early Church’s understanding of the Eucharist through the teachings of the Great Patristic Father, St Cyril of Alexandria. Study everything from the primordial human being, the fallen human condition, God’s plan of restoration, and how the Eucharist is at the center of God’s plan for our salvation.</p>
