<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How do I live a life of resurrection?</strong></p>
<p>We wish you a blessed feast of the holy resurrection. This feast is very important to us and has given us the true meaning of real life.</p>
<p>The Cross and the Resurrection of Christ have been told to be events that are two sides of one coin. This means that since God died in His Humanity, and because He is the source of life, when He is raised it happens very naturally.</p>
<p>Bishop Raphael has demonstrated this concept in a beautiful example. He used a paper and says the paper represents the Humanity of Christ. He dips the paper in water where the water represents the divinity of Christ. Now we have a wet paper (one incarnate God—fully human and fully divine).</p>
<p>When any human dies his soul separates from his body. So looking at the paper example, as God died the soul separates from the body so we tear the paper in half. However in the example the paper is still wet. This means that God’s divinity has not departed from His humanity for a single moment or a twinkling of an eye. The body and the soul are still both human and divine. Since both parts of the paper are wet, we can stick them back together. This is how Christ was raised from the dead. His divinity joined His soul to His body.</p>
<p>Christ’s resurrection has been passed on to us to enjoy eternal life with Him. In 1 Corinthians 15:20, St Paul says: “But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.” The firstfruits are the first batch of fruits that someone reaps in harvest time. The verse is saying that Christ has demonstrated to us the way of salvation and He went through it personally but He expects others to follow in that path.</p>
<p>When Christ died, He expects me to also die to the world; and as He was raised, He expects me to also be raised and conquer sin and tribulation (I am walking in His footsteps).</p>
<p>This concept can be better explained if we look at the life of the caterpillar. The caterpillar lives a normal life where it eats, sleeps and walks very slowly. However, it knows that it needs to die from that environment, so it goes into a cocoon and after sometime it is raised as a glorious butterfly. It becomes a different being completely.</p>
<p>We need to become a new creation in Christ and we need to take the resurrection of Christ and make it ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To live a true life of resurrection, we regularly need to abide in Christ through partaking of the Eucharist. His holy Body and Blood will truly transform us into a new creation. Unlike the caterpillar whose body is transformed into a different creature; through abiding in Christ, each human will be raised, in heaven, with his/her own personal body in a glorified state.</p>
