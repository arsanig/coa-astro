<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, One God, Amen.</p>
<p>We’ve all been told a thousand times in Church and Sunday School: Say your Prayers, Read your Bible… but have you ever grappled with trying to read scripture consistently? Or do you struggle to understand what you read? Then this video is for you. Let’s take a look at this together.</p>
<p>My beloved, it seems obvious to all of us that one of the most essential aspects of the life of the Christian believer, is the belief that Holy Scripture is the inspired word of God handed down to us by the Church in holy written tradition. And no one can believe this and not exert an honest effort in attempting to daily reading scripture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so</span><span data-contrast="auto"> it is fitting for us today, as we continue in our series of “Back to Basics” that we discuss the importance of Holy Scripture as a crucial part of the believers life. And so today we ask the question: </span><span data-contrast="auto">How do I build a connection with Holy Scripture? </span><span data-contrast="auto">Now many of us have attempted several times in our lives to be consistent in our Bible reading. Some have succeeded, many have not. Some complain that while they do read, then don’t retain knowledge, or don’t understand… All of these are hurdles that the believer must both overcome and even anticipate when pursuing a true relationship with Holy Scripture. Like all habits that lead to our salvation, we must expect that we will be warred against with the purpose of having us give up. Nevertheless, it is crucial for us as believers to always remember the importance of daily scriptural readin</span><span data-contrast="auto">g, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and also</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to understand why the Church prescribes this as an essential part of our relationship with the Lord God. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">My father of confession when I was younger used to always tell me, “If you have not read your bible, then don’t eat! Do not feed the body, unless you’ve first fed the soul!” No</span><span data-contrast="auto">w</span><span data-contrast="auto"> some may hear this and think it extreme, but in truth, there is a valuable lesson to be learned here. Scripture is one of the most vital ‘foods’ that the soul will nourish itself on. It is the word of God that sustains the mind and will of the human being. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">After Moses died, the people of Israel had lost their great leader and heroic prophet. Joshua, Moses’ disciple suddenly found himself with the daunting task of filling some very big shoes. It is here that the Lord speaks to Joshua and gives him an extremely important commandment by which he must establish his ministry. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> read together what the Lord commands Joshua: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“[…] B</span><span data-contrast="auto">e strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go. This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” </span><span data-contrast="auto">Joshua 1:</span><span data-contrast="auto">7-</span><span data-contrast="auto">8.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This commandment to Joshua is </span><span data-contrast="auto">clearly applicable to us today. We are called, just as he was, to do three things: 1) have the words of scripture be on our mouth – meaning we should use scripture as the foundation of our lives and speech. Just as Christ himself did when tempted by Satan in the wilderness; His every response was scriptural. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We should therefore be acquainted and even memorize scripture that we may be guarded by its valuable teachings. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">2) </span><span data-contrast="auto">M</span><span data-contrast="auto">ediate in it day and night; the word of God should be the very thing that occupies our mind and hearts, being inspired by those it speaks of as heroes, learning from the lessons found within it, and finding life in it’s very words and teachings – specifically the life and teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as handed down to us in the Gospels</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And finally, 3) That we observe to do all that is found within it. Seeing it as the standard of our lives and actions – the very inspiration of how we ought to </span><span data-contrast="auto">live</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Needless to say, </span><span data-contrast="auto">that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">we can </span><span data-contrast="auto">only </span><span data-contrast="auto">hope to achieve this level of dedication, </span><span data-contrast="auto">is that a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> genuine and committed effort must be made to both read and understand scripture on a daily basis. </span><span data-contrast="auto">For us to be able to do this, </span><span data-contrast="auto">let me suggest a few key principles that would set us up to succeed: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

No one jumps into an ocean when trying to teach one-self how to swim… that would be both futile and dangerous. So </span><span data-contrast="auto">also</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the same applies with diving into scripture. Even scripture itself tells us that we need someone to unlock for us the mysteries found within. When St Philip the apostle saw the Ethiopian Eunuch read</span><span data-contrast="auto">ing</span><span data-contrast="auto"> scripture</span><span data-contrast="auto"> alone</span><span data-contrast="auto">, he asked him, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Do</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you understand what you are reading? The Eunuch replied “</span><span data-contrast="auto">“How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.

Most people will attempt reading right before going to bed. I ask you honestly, is this really the time when you are most awake and focused to receive the word of God? For many, heading to their bedroom at the end of a long day is usually the time where you</span><span data-contrast="auto"> are</span><span data-contrast="auto"> most tired, your mind is exhausted and all you want to do is sleep. If this is the case, then assign a different time to your reading. Try reading at a time when you are refreshed – before </span><span data-contrast="auto">eating or</span><span data-contrast="auto"> studying. Or even in the morning before starting your day. But be consistent and </span><span data-contrast="auto">devote that time every day. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></li>

This must be read carefully with the intention of having an impact on your life. And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so</span><span data-contrast="auto"> if this means we take the time to read, to write notes, to meditate and ask questions to our Spiritual Guides, then so be it!

We are blessed to have access to many Scriptural Commentaries in the Orthodox Church that can help us properly interpret and understand what we are reading. To unlock these hidden gems, we ought to search out what the mind of the Church has to say about the passages that we read. I would personally recommend that you consider using Fr Tadros Malaty’s commentaries. This most blessed Father has written commentaries on almost every book in the Bible and has packed them with historical </span><span data-contrast="auto">and contextual </span><span data-contrast="auto">facts</span><span data-contrast="auto">, spiritual meditations,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as well as Early Church Patristic commentary. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We encourage you please, look him up online and you will surely find the body of his work that can be of great benefit to you as it has been for me. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></li>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now we’ve discussed the ‘how’</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">to approach the establishment of a committed relationship </span><span data-contrast="auto">– however its just as important to speak of the demeanor and the mindset we need to have when approaching scripture.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Lets</span><span data-contrast="auto"> begin with </span><span data-contrast="auto">a great father of the Church, St Irenaeus of Lyon.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">cripture is indeed the solid ground and pillar on which we establish our faith!</span><span data-contrast="auto"> While we do not limit all our understanding of theological matters to Biblical text only, </span><span data-contrast="auto">surely</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we benchmark all our beliefs to that which is revealed to us in the mystery of divinely inspired scripture. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">We begin with the premise that we cannot pick and </span><span data-contrast="auto">choose</span><span data-contrast="auto">, or even reject</span><span data-contrast="auto"> what we like</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or don’t like</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">in </span><span data-contrast="auto">Scripture. As Christians we are called to both accept and understand the cumulative </span><span data-contrast="auto">message </span><span data-contrast="auto">of the entirety of Scripture. We ought never to take a single verse or passage – </span><span data-contrast="auto">often</span><span data-contrast="auto"> even out of context – and make any conclusions based on that.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, St John Chrysostom, who has many poignant sayings on Scripture, teaches us the following: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Rest assured dear brothers and sisters, that no matter how many times we read over the same scriptural passages and stories, that the Holy Spirit will speak something new to us that we </span><span data-contrast="auto">are in need of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> hearing. The Bible is not a novel that we read once and say – done! </span><span data-contrast="auto">Ive</span><span data-contrast="auto"> read it!
