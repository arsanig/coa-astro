<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are many feasts in the liturgical calendar of the Church. But there is one that hold</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the title of the Feast of Feasts – The Holy and Glorious feast of the Resurrection. Stay tuned to find out why this feast is a big deal to all Christians! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Why is the feast of the resurrection consider</span><span data-contrast="auto">ed</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the feast of all feasts? Said differently, why is it such a big deal among Christians</span><span data-contrast="auto">?</span><span data-contrast="auto"> In order to answer this question properly, we must consider a few important things. Many other religions speak symbolically of “dying to oneself”, or the importance of recreation, or new life…and while these themes </span><span data-contrast="auto">and patterns are found in a variety of expressions</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> no faith other than Christianity is willing to make the extremely bold claim that our God took on the </span><span data-contrast="auto">form of a servant, became human, and even died in the flesh for our sakes. But He did not simply </span><span data-contrast="auto">die </span><span data-contrast="auto">– he defeated death in rising from the dead! This unique claim is the cornerstone of our faith – Our God is the author of life and has even conquered death. For this reason, we no longer fear death – dare I say we look forward to it – because we believe that He will raise us up also into everlasting life with Him. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved I would like you to consider the following – if anyone were to somehow disprove the resurrection of Christ, or to somehow refute the resurrection and make us all believe, that without a shadow of a doubt, that Christ never rose from the dead, then our entire Christian faith would be dismantled.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Truth be told, the event of the resurrection of ou</span><span data-contrast="auto">r</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Lord Jesus Christ is single handedly responsible for what gives our Christin faith its meaning and purpose. As a matter of fact, these are the words of St Paul the Apostle – not my own! </span><span data-contrast="auto">You see, there were people within the Corinthian community that were arguing that the resurrection of Christ didn’t happen, or that it didn’t matter. And when St Paul hears of this, he immediately takes action and writes to his spiritual children there to explain that the resurrection of the Lord is in fact indispensable! </span><span data-contrast="auto">St Paul begins by explaining how this tradition was handed down through first hand eye witness accounts: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. 6 After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. 7 After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles. 8 Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.” (1 Corinthians 15: 3-8) </span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Notice how Paul emphasizes that both the Lord’s death and his resurrection are according to the Scriptures. He is pointing to the fact that this was not mere coincidence of circumsta</span><span data-contrast="auto">nce</span><span data-contrast="auto">, but rather </span><span data-contrast="auto">that this is </span><span data-contrast="auto">preordained before all time and the scriptures prophesy and point to their necessity. He then goes on to explain that the Lord’s appearance after his death was not mere hearsay and rumor, but rather hundreds, including Paul himself, saw the Lord alive after his crucifixion and burial. Paul then explains the dangers of denying the resurrection of the Lord: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“12 Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. 14 And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty. 15 Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up—if in fact the dead do not rise. 16 For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. 17 And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins! 18 Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto"> (1 Corinthians 15: 12-17) </span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">I want us to pay attention to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> how St Paul </span><span data-contrast="auto">doesn’t make his argument</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is not</span><span data-contrast="auto"> based on historical or scientific proofs – and this isn’t because there is a lack of evidence. No not at all! </span><span data-contrast="auto">Rather, St Paul makes a much more impactful argument, which is that </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re right, then our faith is useless, and we are all mislead and even liars!</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto"> And More importantly, we are all still in our sins and under the bondage of death! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">St Paul finally makes the crucial point that in His resurrection – in His victory over death itself – that this is the way that the Lord offers life to all those who have been overcome by death: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“20 But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">” (1 Corinthians 15: 20-22) </span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And this is the point of Christianity – He came that we may have life – His life! So just as in Adam, our forefather, we have all inherited corruption, alienation from God, and ultimately death, in Christ Jesus, we are rendered incorrupt, our relationship with God is restored, and we are given life anew. </span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">o deny the resurrection, or act as if its no big deal, is so say that we are still in our former state of hopelessness. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the liturgy of St Basil that is prayed in the Coptic Orthodox Church, there is a very powerful sentence that strikes me every time I </span><span data-contrast="auto">pray</span><span data-contrast="auto"> it. We say: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“He loved His own who were in the world, and, as a ransom on our behalf, gave Himself up unto death, [death] which reigned over us, whereby we were bound and sold on account of our sins.” [Liturgy of St Basil – Coptic Orthodox Rite]</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I want us to notice how we speak </span><span data-contrast="auto">here</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of death as if it were a tyrant that held us captive – “death which reigned over us” – “we were bound and sold”. And this is precisely how we perceive death – as an oppressor or </span><span data-contrast="auto">monster</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of some sort, that enslaved humanity because all human souls, before the resurrection of Christ, were doomed to spend eternity in Hades.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> And so this monster called death needed to be destroyed – and who better to this than Him who is life! St Cyril of Alexandria addresses this by explaining this it is through the death of Christ, and His resurrection, that he defeats this enemy of humanity. Lets read together what St Cyril says: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">For the sake of all he tasted death. Although by nature he was life and was himself the resurrection, he surrendered his own body to death. By his ineffable power he trampled upon death in his own flesh that he might become the firstborn from the dead and the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep…Even if the resurrection of the dead may be said to be through a man, the man we know it is through is the Word begotten of God. The power of death has been destroyed through him. </span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">[St Cyril of Alexandria &#8211; Letter</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto"> 17.11</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">]</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">No wonder the resurrection is so important to us as Christians – it is the very fulfillment of the liberation of God’s people! He destroys the enemy by demonstrating that He is life – the very antidote of death. And when death came face to face, with the God-Man Jesus Christ – it was destroyed and lost its eternal grip on humanity. We were restored in His resurrection, and this why all Christians both die with Him, and rise with Him in the mystery of baptism – that we may all share in His victory over death. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">So during this period of the glorious days of the resurrection, lets remember why we chant the anthem of Orthodoxy for 50 straight days: </span><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“Chris is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death and upon those in the tombs bestowing life.”</span></i></b><span data-contrast="auto"> It is because we believe that this is what restored our hope for true and eternal life. Lets also remember why we salute one another with the greeting of “Christ is risen” – it’s because of the importance and the power of the Lord’s victory and salvation. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved, for all these reasons, we celebrate the feast of the resurrection with great joy! It is truly the feast of feasts</span><span data-contrast="auto">. For these reasons will not only celebrate a past event – rather we live a real, timeless, and everlasting victory as Christians – Khristos Anesti! Christ is risen my beloved. Glory be to the Risen Lord! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
