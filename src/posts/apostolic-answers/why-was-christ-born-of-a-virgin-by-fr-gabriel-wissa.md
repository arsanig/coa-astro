<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen Why was Christ born of the Virgin St. Mary? Why did she have to be a virgin? Is marriage dishonorable and that is why she needed to be a virgin? Or, is sexuality within marriage frowned upon? We will tackle all those questions in this video. Marriage is a sacramental gift from God and it mirrors the love within the All-Holy Trinity. Evidently, it is an honorable gift. St. Paul says in Hebrews: “Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled…” So not only is marriage honorable, the bed is pure.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sexuality within marriage is an expression of the love between the two spouses. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Marriage is</span><span data-contrast="auto">, therefore,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> natural and holy. That is why God created them </span><span data-contrast="auto">at the beginning </span><span data-contrast="auto">male and female and He </span><span data-contrast="auto">also </span><span data-contrast="auto">blessed the wedding of Cana of Galilee by His Presence. B</span><span data-contrast="auto">ut</span><span data-contrast="auto"> why is He born of a virgin</span><span data-contrast="auto"> then</span><span data-contrast="auto">? Was He </span><span data-contrast="auto">seeking to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> avoid a natural </span><span data-contrast="auto">human birth derived </span><span data-contrast="auto">from a </span><span data-contrast="auto">marital sexual union</span><span data-contrast="auto">? No, </span><span data-contrast="auto">that’s not what is </span><span data-contrast="auto">at stake</span><span data-contrast="auto"> here</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">In fact, </span><span data-contrast="auto">St. Cyril asked the same question, he said: “…why did the Word, who is God, make a virgin the mother of his own flesh with a conception straight from the Holy Spirit?” Then, he </span><span data-contrast="auto">began to </span><span data-contrast="auto">answer:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “…the Son came, or rather was made man, in order to reconstitute our condition within Himself; first of </span><span data-contrast="auto">all</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in his own holy, wonderful, and truly amazing birth and life.”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">So, before answering specifically the reason of the virgin birth, he emphasizes</span><span data-contrast="auto">, here, </span><span data-contrast="auto">a theological truth </span><span data-contrast="auto">which could be seen throughout the writings of the Alexandrian Fathers</span><span data-contrast="auto">. This truth</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is that salvation is synonymous with recreation. God was incarnate to recreate us. To heal us. To restore us. This recreation </span><span data-contrast="auto">is as needed as</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the forgiveness of </span><span data-contrast="auto">our </span><span data-contrast="auto">sins</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">salvation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is not only about paying a ransom for our sins, but, it is </span><span data-contrast="auto">all the more</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">about </span><span data-contrast="auto">recreating humanity and bringing us back to our original state</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">A state of purity, of wisdom, of true joy, free from sin, reunited with Him through His Holy Spirit within us.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, the reason Christ </span><span data-contrast="auto">wa</span><span data-contrast="auto">s born of a virgin, lived a full human life, was baptized in the Jordan river, was crucified, resurrected</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">ascended to heaven, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and sent us His Holy Spirit, </span><span data-contrast="auto">wa</span><span data-contrast="auto">s </span><span data-contrast="auto">to </span><span data-contrast="auto">recreate us. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Now, </span><span data-contrast="auto">let us</span><span data-contrast="auto"> go</span><span data-contrast="auto"> back to the virgin birth</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> S</span><span data-contrast="auto">t. Cyril continues and says: “…This was why He himself became the first one to be born of the Holy Spirit (I mean of course after the flesh) so that He could trace a path for grace to come to us. He wanted us to have this intellectual regeneration and spiritual assimilation to himself, who is the true and natural Son, so that we too might be able to call God our Father, and so remain free of corruption as no longer owing our first father, that is Adam, in whom we were corrupted.”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">So, Christ is born from a virgin to trace a path </span><span data-contrast="auto">of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> grace for us (</span><span data-contrast="auto">meaning </span><span data-contrast="auto">it is done for our salvation). </span><span data-contrast="auto">Since Christ, who is </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">natural Son of the Father, was born of the Holy Spirit </span><span data-contrast="auto">rather than </span><span data-contrast="auto">from </span><span data-contrast="auto">a human father</span><span data-contrast="auto">, us too, when we are baptized, or born again from above</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through the same Holy Spirit</span><span data-contrast="auto">, we become sons and daughters of God the Father. In other words, Christ liberated us from the bondage of being children of the first Adam and</span><span data-contrast="auto">, instead,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> made us children of God the Father through adoption. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And He did this </span><span data-contrast="auto">shift </span><span data-contrast="auto">by </span><span data-contrast="auto">avoiding </span><span data-contrast="auto">having </span><span data-contrast="auto">a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> father on earth</span><span data-contrast="auto">, and by b</span><span data-contrast="auto">eing born</span><span data-contrast="auto">, in His humanity,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> directly </span><span data-contrast="auto">from</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Holy </span><span data-contrast="auto">Spirit instead. </span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">o, since</span><span data-contrast="auto"> He has no share in the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> humanity of the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> first Adam, </span><span data-contrast="auto">we</span><span data-contrast="auto"> too, when </span><span data-contrast="auto">we are </span><span data-contrast="auto">baptized, </span><span data-contrast="auto">we</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will not have any share in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">corrupted humanity of the </span><span data-contrast="auto">first Adam</span><span data-contrast="auto"> anymore</span><span data-contrast="auto">, but have a share only in the second Adam, who is Christ. </span><span data-contrast="auto">As St. Paul says: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body</span><span data-contrast="auto">…</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">And by being in Christ, </span><span data-contrast="auto">the natural Son of the Father, </span><span data-contrast="auto">we </span><span data-contrast="auto">have </span><span data-contrast="auto">access to the </span><span data-contrast="auto">F</span><span data-contrast="auto">atherhood of </span><span data-contrast="auto">God the Father and only then can we say with St. Paul: “[we] </span><span data-contrast="auto">received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, ‘Abba, Father.’”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">This is precisely why</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">in Matthew 23, He says: “call no man on earth your father.” As we have seen in a previous video entitled “</span><span data-contrast="auto">Should you address a priest as ‘father’?</span><span data-contrast="auto">” (</span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">link </span><span data-contrast="auto">will be </span><span data-contrast="auto">in the comments </span><span data-contrast="auto">below) that these words were not meant literally but had a greater significance</span><span data-contrast="auto">: th</span><span data-contrast="auto">ere is a good fatherhood </span><span data-contrast="auto">that is found </span><span data-contrast="auto">in God and a bad one </span><span data-contrast="auto">that is </span><span data-contrast="auto">linked to the first Adam and it is </span><span data-contrast="auto">corrupt and </span><span data-contrast="auto">outside of God.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> A</span><span data-contrast="auto">lso, </span><span data-contrast="auto">when He met Mary Magdalene the day of the resurrection, He told her</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">“I am </span><span data-contrast="auto">ascending to My Father and your Father.” </span><span data-contrast="auto">He is differentiating between </span><span data-contrast="auto">our sonship</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and Hi</span><span data-contrast="auto">s Sonship</span><span data-contrast="auto">. He says: “I am ascending to My Father” since He </span><span data-contrast="auto">is the natural </span><span data-contrast="auto">Son of the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Father</span><span data-contrast="auto">. And then He continues: “…and your Father”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">because we are the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Father</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s children</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through adoption. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And</span><span data-contrast="auto">, t</span><span data-contrast="auto">his was possible because of the </span><span data-contrast="auto">v</span><span data-contrast="auto">irgin birth</span>.</p>
