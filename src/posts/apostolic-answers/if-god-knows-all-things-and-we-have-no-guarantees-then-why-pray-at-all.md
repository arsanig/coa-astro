<p><span data-contrast="auto">Seems </span><span data-contrast="auto">to me like God doesn’t always come through when I pray. Somethings I pray for </span><span data-contrast="auto">things that are good</span><span data-contrast="auto">, and yet even then there is no guarantee that He will make them happen. So what’s the point? </span><span data-contrast="auto">And doesn’t He know what I need ahead of time anyways? </span><span data-contrast="auto">If you’ve ever had this kind of thought cross your mind, then stick around, and lets see what the Church offers as an answer. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved, its clear that many of us may be tempted to think in this way and to be tempted to lose heart and faith in the promises of the Lord. There seems to be this idea among many Christians that as long as we ask for good and Godly things, then surely God will give them to us. And seeing as how God is omnipotent and He loves us, then surely He will not deprive us from those good things that we are asking for…and yet, even the One Holy Church is filled with history and examples to prove the complete opposite of this. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Church has been praying for peace in the world for thousands of years, that’s not happening. We pray for the healing of the sick, and the people still die. We pray God’s protection for his children and his Church, and yet the rate of persecution and violence continues to rise. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And even though we say God knows all things, we still continue to ask Him for all these things daily in our liturgical prayers. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Does that then mean prayer is useless, </span><span data-contrast="auto">or that </span><span data-contrast="auto">it doesn’t work? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To begin answering this we must first take a step back. There are some major fallacies in this way of thinking. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s address two of those misconceptions in today’s video. </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Misconception #1: God promises </span><span data-contrast="auto">He will answer our prayers; </span><span data-contrast="auto">therefore,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> He needs to come through</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and give us what we ask for</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Now some people might hear that and say “No, its not like that, what we mean is…” and then they would tone down the statement. But if we are honest, this is truly what we mean. But did He promise that? Is that what we see in Scripture? </span><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> take </span><span data-contrast="auto">for instance </span><span data-contrast="auto">the greatest example of prayer in Scripture found in the gospels, when the Lord Jesus is Praying in the garden of Gethsemane. He makes a request to His Father</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and is HOW H</span><span data-contrast="auto">e </span><span data-contrast="auto">does it that places before us</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the </span><span data-contrast="auto">model of </span><span data-contrast="auto">prayer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we need to all adopt</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Let’s take a look: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">38 Then He said to them</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto"> (His disciples)</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.”</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.”</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto"> […] </span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">42 Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.”</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Pay attention to the words my beloved, The Lord Jesus teaches us to place our requests before God in prayer, but to always express that we desire God’s will above all. Meaning that we trust in what He will allow for the sake of what He see’s best. And again, the Lord comes back a second time and even prays and says if I don’t get what I asked for, then I accept</span><span data-contrast="auto"> your will</span><span data-contrast="auto">! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Do you see</span><span data-contrast="auto"> how even the Lord Himself, the Word of God incarnate, did not spare himself to experience </span><span data-contrast="auto">complete</span><span data-contrast="auto"> submission in prayer? How He allows himself to be in full obedience to the will of God His father and sets before is the example of how prayer is not merely transactional, but truly relational? And this is where we can learn so much. Too many of us have a vending machine approach with God. I place my </span><span data-contrast="auto">money in the machine</span><span data-contrast="auto">, press the button, and expect to get what I want! And if I don’t, I push and shove the machine and get all upset. Another example of this is </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">genie in the lamp approach, where I think that if I say the magic words, and rub the lamp in the right way, that the genie is now obliged to grant me my wishes…</span><span data-contrast="auto"> My beloved, God is not the vending machine nor the genie. He is our Father, eternal, all powerful, and all loving. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We either believe these things about God, or we don’t. And if we do trust in his timing, his mercy, his justice, and his love, then o</span><span data-contrast="auto">ur </span><span data-contrast="auto">expectations for prayer will be focused on building relationship with Him. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Which leads to the 2</span><span data-contrast="auto">nd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> misconception: Our prayers are a way to inform God or to place our orders before Him. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s be clear my beloved, in prayer, we aren’t really telling God anything he doesn’t already know.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Again, some might then ask, then w</span><span data-contrast="auto">h</span><span data-contrast="auto">y pray at all</span><span data-contrast="auto">?</span><span data-contrast="auto"> The answer is relationship and intimacy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Take for example a father who was told this morning the detailed account of a funny incident that happened between his two children. When his youngest child comes eagerly to him, excited to share with </span><span data-contrast="auto">h</span><span data-contrast="auto">im the details of what happened, what is the Father’s response? Does he </span><span data-contrast="auto">interrupt</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the child and </span><span data-contrast="auto">say,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “I already know all this, don’t waste my time!” Or does he sit there and listen to every word, even sometimes pretending to not know for the sake of encouraging the child to communicate all that he or she has to say? </span><span data-contrast="auto">To connect, to share, to grow the relationship… </span><span data-contrast="auto">The same exists with Our Lord. He allows us to communicate all that is in out hearts for our sakes, not His! </span><span data-contrast="auto">Allow me to say that t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he Lord benefits </span><span data-contrast="auto">nothing, </span><span data-contrast="auto">from our prayers, he is </span><span data-contrast="auto">afterall</span><span data-contrast="auto"> immutable and unchangeable.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">St John Chrysostom comments on this very idea and express</span><span data-contrast="auto">es it</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to us beautifully</span><span data-contrast="auto">. He explains </span><span data-contrast="auto">how we ought to approach God in prayer. He says the following: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“[We pray] not to inform God or instruct Him but to beseech Him closely, to be made intimate with Him, by continuance in supplication; to be humbled; to be reminded of our sins.” – St John Chrysostom (Homily 19, Gospel of Matthew)</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to this great saint, prayer isn’t about </span><span data-contrast="auto">an exchange of information or a transactional process by which we place orders with God the way we do with a waiter at a restaurant. No! it is for the sake of intimacy, for conversation, for comfort, humility, peace, and ultimately love. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved, let us be encouraged to understand prayer as the Lord always intended us to see it. Let us learn from the Lord Himself how to submit to God’s will in prayer.
