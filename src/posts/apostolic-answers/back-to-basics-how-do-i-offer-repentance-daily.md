<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen. What is daily repentance and how do I offer it? My beloved, we have heard many times over in our life of the importance of repentance and confession. We here at Coptic Orthodox Answers have even done several videos explaining the mystery of Repentance and Confession and we urge you to watch those videos if you want to take a deeper look. However, for today, we want to address the significance of daily repentance and how its an critical building block of the Christian life. Essentially, we want to understand what it means to offer daily repentance and how we can practically do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">First, </span><span data-contrast="auto">let’s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> briefly remind ourselves of what repentance means. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The word for repentance in </span><span data-contrast="auto">Greek</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is “Metanoia” – meaning a change in mind. This change doesn’t simply happen at the level of our thoughts, but rather it signifies a change at the level of what Scripture calls the “Heart” – or often referred</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> within Orthodox Spirituality as the “Nous”. This Nous is the faculty of the soul that allows us to see and feel God the Holy Spirit. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Its</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the heart, the mind, and the eyes of the human soul.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> To have a change in this is to redirect ourselves constantly towards God. You see, its not enough to face God (stand in his direction) but rather to move towards Him. This is repentance – the movement of the soul towards her Creator in a sincere attempt to be united to Him.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Now that we have a brief idea of what that means, lets look at practically </span><span data-contrast="auto">what </span><span data-contrast="auto">this would translate into if we were to practice this daily. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Earlier on in this video, we briefly said that repentance is not so much a destination as much as it is a journey. And </span><span data-contrast="auto">indeed,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> it’s a journey of a lifetime. And just like any journey, it takes a daily and consistent effort if ever we want to complete this journey with success. Now the daily journey of repentance is one where the Christian is constantly benchmarking themselves in asking </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">where have I missed the mark today</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> – and notice how this idea of missing the mark is precisely what sin means. </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">Where have I fallen short, where do I need to correct myself, where can I be better and improve</span><span data-contrast="auto">…”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Now let me take a moment a say something here. Many may listen to this and think “this is so typical, Christianity is all about guilt and </span><span data-contrast="auto">motivating</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">change</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through self-shaming, etc.” My beloved, I </span><span data-contrast="auto">can’t</span><span data-contrast="auto"> begin to express how wrong this kind of talk is. Self-improvement is impossible with</span><span data-contrast="auto">out</span><span data-contrast="auto"> self-critici</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">m. To avoid criticism because of how it makes me feel is to say I </span><span data-contrast="auto">wont</span><span data-contrast="auto"> go see a doctor because ill be sad if he says I’m sick! </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you would rather remain sick and not </span><span data-contrast="auto">be treated</span><span data-contrast="auto">, rather than dealing with the feelings of knowing you’re sick while pursuing healing? </span><span data-contrast="auto">Needless to say, Christianity</span><span data-contrast="auto"> takes spiritual illnesses just as seriously, if not even more seriously, than bodily sickness. So please, lets address this properly and agree that pursuing spiritual health is an absolute must for any serious Christian. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That being said, how</span><span data-contrast="auto"> do I even begin to </span><span data-contrast="auto">make this assessment. For this, let me propose a very simple </span><span data-contrast="auto">process</span><span data-contrast="auto">. We need to commit to doing three crucial things (one that is daily, one that is weekly, and another monthly). </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On a daily basis</span><span data-contrast="auto">, I need to self-assess and take note of those things that I want to improve on in my life. I need to learn to forgive, I need to </span><span data-contrast="auto">control my tongue and watch my words, </span><span data-contrast="auto">I need to be more </span><span data-contrast="auto">caring</span><span data-contrast="auto"> with my </span><span data-contrast="auto">family</span><span data-contrast="auto">, I need to spend more time in prayer, and so on… </span><span data-contrast="auto">Daily self-reflection and even journal keeping if it helps the person stay committed. And </span><span data-contrast="auto">also</span><span data-contrast="auto"> daily, turn to God in prayer asking for His love and mercy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On a weekly basis</span><span data-contrast="auto">, I need to approach the altar with reverence in pursuit of God’s grace and mercy and partake of the Holy Eucharist. The Holy Body and the Precious Blood of Christ truly are the medicine of immortality that give me life! Whatever is dead within me is restored back through my partaking of Him who is life! And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I must approach the mysteries in pursuit of this healing and restoration. It is the Eucharist that will fuel my desire to continue in my journey to repentance. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And finally, the one thing monthly, which is to humbly and persistently pursue the grace of the Absolution that is granted to me in the mystery of confession. This is where I present myself to God in the presence of His priest and confess my sins that I have been daily reviewing. In doing so, I </span><span data-contrast="auto">ask</span><span data-contrast="auto"> God </span><span data-contrast="auto">to take away and carry for me </span><span data-contrast="auto">what I have </span><span data-contrast="auto">realized that I cannot carry. I</span><span data-contrast="auto"> ask Him to blot out my sins and </span><span data-contrast="auto">loosen</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the bonds that are enslaving me. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Daily assessment and prayer. Weekly participation of the Eucharist. And Monthly Confession. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved, the Church in her wisdom, has handed down to us many teachings that inform us of how we ought to pursue this kind of repentance. We see in scripture the importance of humbly approaching our </span><span data-contrast="auto">creator</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and placing before him all that we are. And in so doing, we are taught that He will restore us. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">For instance, in the book of Sirach, we hear the wise teachings that say the following: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">24 </span><span data-contrast="auto">[…]</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">o those who repent he grants a return,</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">    and he encourages those whose endurance is failing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">25 Turn to the Lord and forsake your sins;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">    pray in his presence and lessen your offenses.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">26 Return to the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Most High</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and turn away from iniquity,</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">    and hate abominations intensely.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” (Sirach 17:24-26) </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">These words describe perfectly the actions that happen within us when we offer daily repentance: “return, endurance, turn away, hate sin…” this is what </span><span data-contrast="auto">we</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">are</span><span data-contrast="auto"> taught to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> do</span><span data-contrast="auto"> daily </span><span data-contrast="auto">in order to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> remain on </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">life</span><span data-contrast="auto">-long path towards</span><span data-contrast="auto"> repentance. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now St Cyril of Alexandria, goes on further to explain that when the penitent Christian pursues this kind of repentance, he will begin to bear fruit – or said differently, will begin to see changes in his life. And this change specifically, will be the manifestation of true faith</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and Godly actions</span><span data-contrast="auto">! Listen to what St Cyril says: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">Moreover, the fruit of repentance is, in the highest degree, faith in Christ: and next to it, the evangelic mode of life, and in general terms the works of righteousness in contradistinction to sin, which the penitent must bring forth as fruits worthy of repentance.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ultimately, this daily offering to God, where I turn back to him through the process of identifying sin, rejecting it, and choosing to return to God, is precisely the actions that will lead to my union with Him. Now </span><span data-contrast="auto">all this being said, we</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will always encourage that every person share their ideas and intentions with their own Fathers of Confession and Spiritual guides in order for them to be properly counselled as to how to apply these rules in their own lives. So please, make sure to always turn to your Spiritual guides before jumping in </span><span data-contrast="auto">headfirst</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But in general, and for the sake of this video, we note that the Church has taught us, that if we as Christians, keep these simple rules, and apply them daily, we will condition the soul to always identify what is sinful and hurtful to her, and in the process instill in her the constant pursuit of God through daily repentance</span></p>
