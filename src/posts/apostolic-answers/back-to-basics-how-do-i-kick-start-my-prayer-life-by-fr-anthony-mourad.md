<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.</p>
<p>My beloved today we start a new series called Back to Basics. In this series we speak of the practical side of a spiritual life: the “how to” of the most fundamental elements of the Christian lifestyle. And we cannot possibly begin this series without first talking about prayer. And so in this first video of the series, we will attempt to answer the question of “How do I kick-start my prayer life?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">First let’s address a </span><span data-contrast="auto">very crucial point </span><span data-contrast="auto">in regard to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the spiritual life</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Always keep in mind that the Christian is called to be in a relationship with all Holy Trinity. We are called to know God, and to be known by Him. And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Christian must always keep at the forefront of his mind that all that we do is in pursuit of a genuine relationship with God. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as we discuss prayer, this is not in any way an attempt to teach you how to </span><span data-contrast="auto">mechanically go about prayer – as if this were an instructional video on how to stretch or how to build a dinning room table. No! this is more an attempt at explaining the different ways and the different the tools our mother the Church has set before us to connect and be united to God in and through prayer. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before we begin, l</span><span data-contrast="auto">et me share three key things to consider: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">#1 </span><span data-contrast="auto">We ought to know that prayer is not the repetition of empty </span><span data-contrast="auto">ritual, rather prayer is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the soul’s attempt at union with her Creator. </span><span data-contrast="auto">It is a state of being, not merely an action of spoken words. While the words given to us by the Church are extremely powerful, they are of no use unless they pour out of a sincere heart. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">#2 Prayer does not need to be complicated</span><span data-contrast="auto">; God isn’t seeking poetry and sophistication. David the psalmist says this clearly when he </span><span data-contrast="auto">says,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “</span><span data-contrast="auto">The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">A broken and a contrite heart—These, O God, You will not despise.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (Psalm 51:17)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">Even </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">he Lord Jesus Christ </span><span data-contrast="auto">speaks of the righteous tax collector who asked for forgiveness in his prayer and says: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">I tell </span><span data-contrast="auto">you;</span><span data-contrast="auto"> this man went down to his house justified</span><span data-contrast="auto">…</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (Luke 18: 14)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved the Lord isn’t so much concerned with the quantity or quality of our words, but rather the state of our heart. He desires us</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> personally, more than anything else. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">#3 Prayer </span><span data-contrast="auto">is not limited only to my bedroom, but to be </span><span data-contrast="auto">spoken </span><span data-contrast="auto">at all times and in all places</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as the heart desires.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Now this in no way means that </span><span data-contrast="auto">I</span><span data-contrast="auto"> ought to stop setting time aside to stand before His face in the privacy of my room, but it means that on top of this we ought to also have God on our hearts and minds everywhere and at all times. </span><span data-contrast="auto">St Basil the great councils us and says that we ought to have God on our mind’s in every little thing that we do. Listen to what he says”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“When you sit down to eat, pray. When you eat bread, do so thanking Him for being so generous to you. If you drink wine, be mindful of Him who has given it to you for your pleasure and as a relief in sickness. When you dress, thank Him for His kindness in providing you with clothes. When you look at the sky and the beauty of the stars, throw yourself at God’s feet and adore Him who in His wisdom has arranged things in this way. Similarly, when the sun goes down and when it rises, when you are asleep or awake, give thanks to God, who created and arranged all things for your benefit, to have you know, love and praise their Creator.”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> [</span><span data-contrast="auto">St. Basil the Great, from Homily V</span><span data-contrast="auto">]</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in this we learn, while personal time in prayer in our bedrooms is essential, communication or rather communion with God at all times and in all things is necessary! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before we discuss some of the ways we can begin to pray, I would like to share with you one last and most essential idea about prayer. In order for me to succeed in having a consistent prayer life, I must see prayer as a nonnegotiable! Communion with God must be at the top of my list of priorities, not merely something I work towards if I have time… Think of it this way: we would never consider going to school or to work without first washing our face in the morning, or brushing our teeth, or even getting properly dressed. To us these are all non-negotiables – we will not face the world unless I have done these. Why then do I not see prayer or my standing before my God as just as important as these tasks. If I don’t dare go to work without putting on my work clothes, do I really believe I can face the day without first asking for His grace and His blessings? No, my beloved – prayer must be a non-negotiable! I must believe that I cannot begin or end my day without it! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> what are some of the ways the Church sets before us to begin praying. Today we will attempt to briefly discuss </span><span data-contrast="auto">5</span><span data-contrast="auto"> ways that can all be used when pursuing a relationship with the Lord. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s begin with the most communal and formal way; the Liturgical prayer life. Over the centuries, the Church, who is in love with her saviour has decorated her liturgical prayers with beautiful words, </span><span data-contrast="auto">hymnology</span><span data-contrast="auto">, doxologies, and even scriptural readings so that it can present to both God and the laity the best that has to offer. And so, in the Orthodox Church, where we celebrate Divine Liturg</span><span data-contrast="auto">ies</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Matins and </span><span data-contrast="auto">Vespers prayers,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and other forms of Liturgical worship,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Christian person is exposed to beautiful prayerful language where one of the models</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of prayer is </span><span data-contrast="auto">made accessible</span><span data-contrast="auto">. This then becomes a school</span><span data-contrast="auto"> where we can learn the language and the demeanour of prayer, where we see before us the example of true offering and Eucharist, where we hear the Words of </span><span data-contrast="auto">Holy Scripture, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and we have set before us examples of the saints that have become victors in their relationship with the Lord. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another tool and model of prayer that the Church makes accessible to us is the canonical book of the hours. In the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Coptic Orthodox rite, this is known as the AGPEYA. In this book, the Church offers its children a model of structured prayer. It teaches how we ought to begin with thanksgiving and</span><span data-contrast="auto"> then</span><span data-contrast="auto"> repentance in reciting psalm 5</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-contrast="auto">. It is then filled with the beauty of the psalms, readings of the segments of the gospels, and then litanies and other prayers that the Church ha</span><span data-contrast="auto">nded down to us in order to </span><span data-contrast="auto">elevate </span><span data-contrast="auto">our</span><span data-contrast="auto"> heart</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to God. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And while some people may express that they have difficulty reciting words that are not their own, I urge them to adopt a different perspective. See this as you would see a greeting card: while the words were written by another, they often express what you could not put into words. And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as we read the words of the psalmist or the words of the Church, let them inspire us to then add to them our own words and in so doing be in communion with God. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Which then leads us to yet Another model of prayer…the free cry of the heart. </span><span data-contrast="auto">This </span><span data-contrast="auto">3</span><span data-contrast="auto">rd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> model </span><span data-contrast="auto">is when the heart simply overflows. In thanksgiving, in supplications, in </span><span data-contrast="auto">repentance and the pursuit of mercy, in the remembrance of others, and many other things. </span><span data-contrast="auto">For some, this is difficult because in the beginning we lack </span><span data-contrast="auto">the words to express what we want to say. The heart knows, but the tongue lacks the experience of expression. And this is where liturgy and the AGPEYA, or the prayers written by the Church can be of great use. They teach us the vocabulary to express what the Soul is seeking. For others, it comes easily. It flows naturally as simple prayer. Fr Matthew the Poor, a great contemporary teacher in the Coptic </span><span data-contrast="auto">Orthodox </span><span data-contrast="auto">Church says the following in his book called the Orthodox Prayer Life: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“[Simple Prayer] is an </span><span data-contrast="auto">intimate and fervent discourse in which the soul speaks with God, its creator,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">expressing its feelings. Such feelings may be glorification of his works, attributes,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">or wisdom, or thankfulness for his mercy and his transcendent and humble</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">care.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">Here, the soul might be afire during this silent meditation and thus could</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">not bear to keep silent any longer. It breaks forth into unchecked words that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">express love, worship, and submission, as a child expresses in his feeble words</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">his strong feelings. The heart, which quakes with the touches of the hidden</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">hand of God, is thereupon laid open before him.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” [Fr Matthew the poor – Orthodox Prayer Life] </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><span data-contrast="auto">fourth</span><span data-contrast="auto"> model that the Church lays before as us a tool in prayer, is the repetition of short and very powerful sentences. A great example of this the very </span><span data-contrast="auto">well-known</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Jesus Prayer: Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, Have mercy on me a sinner”. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Another short and powerful prayer is the one recommended to us by St </span><span data-contrast="auto">Macarius</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Great, who </span><span data-contrast="auto">when his </span><span data-contrast="auto">disciples asked him how they ought to pray he simply answered: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">There is no need at all to make long discourses; it is enough to stretch out one’s hands and say, ‘Lord, as you will, and as you know, have mercy.’ And if the conflict grows fiercer say, ‘Lord, help!’ He knows very well what we need and He shows us His mercy.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Lord, as you will, ad you know, have mercy.” </span><span data-contrast="auto">Indeed,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a very powerful and helpful prayer to memorize and repeat throughout the day. And I believe the simplest of all prayers is that which our Orthodox Church repeats many times throughout her prayers: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">Kyrie Eleison</span><span data-contrast="auto">”: Lord have mercy! </span><span data-contrast="auto">All of these are great examples of short and powerful sentences that a person can repeat and have on their heart all throughout the day: as they drive, as they stand in line for coffee, as they eat their supper, and even as they speak to others. This is how we can pray everywhere and at all times!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Finally, the last tool and model or prayer </span><span data-contrast="auto">that we will look at</span><span data-contrast="auto">, is silence and stillness. </span><span data-contrast="auto">This is when a person can simply sit before the Lord and from that stillness receive grace because of the awareness of God’s presence. Just as two lovers can sit quietly in each other’s embrace without saying a </span><span data-contrast="auto">thing</span><span data-contrast="auto">, and not feel the need to express a word because their presence is sufficient for them. And so even this, the silent and still heart, </span><span data-contrast="auto">is </span><span data-contrast="auto">yet another way that the Christian can commune with God in a perfect state of prayer. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved, as we have seen, our Mother the Church sets before us a collection of tools, all of which can help us build a sincere relationship with our God. Not one of these is more or less important than the other, and everyone is meant to use all of them at some point </span><span data-contrast="auto">and all throughout </span><span data-contrast="auto">their lives. And now that we have seen some vary basic ways on how to pray, I urge all of you to speak to your Spiritual Guides and Fathers of confession so that through their guidance and in a spirit of discipleship, you may be properly counselled as to which of these to begin using as you start your journey in prayer.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
