<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.</p>
<p>Can a Christian believe in the Big Bang theory? Does the Big Bang contradict Scripture? And if the Big Bang is true, what implications does such a theory have on Christianity? Let us explore together this vital subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As you have seen in the first video </span><span data-contrast="auto">i</span><span data-contrast="auto">n this series </span><span data-contrast="auto">o</span><span data-contrast="auto">n </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">Christianity and Science</span><span data-contrast="auto">’, Orthodox Christians in the first centuries AD deeply studied the different sciences of the time. They didn’t shy away from science but happily engaged with it. Now, since the early 20</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto"> century, </span><span data-contrast="auto">so fairly recently</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">scientists have discovered that the universe is not static, as people thought at the time, but it is expanding. And if it is expanding today, then</span><span data-contrast="auto"> if we go far back in time, it must have been originated from a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> single point, which scientists call ‘the singularity</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Now, don’t worry I am not planning on making </span><span data-contrast="auto">this video overly complicated. In fact, </span><span data-contrast="auto">the Big Bang has a wide range of empirical evidence and this </span><span data-contrast="auto">information </span><span data-contrast="auto">is readily available online </span><span data-contrast="auto">so this video does not aim at </span><span data-contrast="auto">providing hard evidence for the Big Bang</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">The purpose of this video is to look at the implications of the Big Bang theory on Christianity</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and try to look passed the Big Bang and draw some conclusions from there</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> And, t</span><span data-contrast="auto">oward the end of the video, I will share some </span><span data-contrast="auto">facts </span><span data-contrast="auto">that I</span><span data-contrast="auto"> personally</span><span data-contrast="auto"> find quite impressive</span><span data-contrast="auto"> so </span><span data-contrast="auto">stick</span><span data-contrast="auto"> with me till the end</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So what is the Big Bang theory? It is an explosion that occurred around 13.8 billion years ago</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> according to scientists</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and this explosion was the </span><span data-contrast="auto">beginning of 4 things: time, space, matter and energy</span><span data-contrast="auto">, where t</span><span data-contrast="auto">ime and space are often </span><span data-contrast="auto">referred to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as space-time continuum or spacetime. </span><span data-contrast="auto">I’ll get back to these 4 later. </span><span data-contrast="auto">After</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Big Bang, t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he universe started with a very high-density and </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">high-temperature state, then, the universe cooled enough to allow for the formation </span><span data-contrast="auto">of </span><span data-contrast="auto">subatomic particles, then atoms; which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies and ultimately led to life as we see it today. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Some might be asking themselves ‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">well, wait </span><span data-contrast="auto">a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> second,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">doesn’t the Big Bang contradict Scripture?’ </span><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><span data-contrast="auto">simple </span><span data-contrast="auto">answer </span><span data-contrast="auto">is </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘No, it doesn’t.’ God willing,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in the future,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we can make a separate video focusing solely on this question.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">But for now, let us stick to the purpose of this video.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When objectively looking at the universe today, scientists can see a high level of precision in the universe. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Let me give</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you a few </span><span data-contrast="auto">quick </span><span data-contrast="auto">examples. </span><span data-contrast="auto">First, the cosmological constant… this constant is linked with the observed acceleration of the universe’s expansion. </span><span data-contrast="auto">If the universe had expanded slightly slower than it did, the universe expansion would have stopped and collapsed on itself. On the other hand, if it expanded faster, than no galaxies would have formed. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Another example is gravity, if the gravitational force </span><span data-contrast="auto">were altered by</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a percentage of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> 0</span><span data-contrast="auto"> followed by 37 zeros </span><span data-contrast="auto">and a 1, </span><span data-contrast="auto">our sun would not exist, and, therefore,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">there would be </span><span data-contrast="auto">no life on earth. </span><span data-contrast="auto">As a last quick example, let us consider the 23-degree axis tilt of the earth. The angle of this tilt is perfectly adjusted with our sun. In fact, if the tilt were slightly altered the earth surface temperature would be too extreme for life. These 3 examples, or 3 Anthropic Constants, provide a small idea of the level of design we can see in the universe. Astrophysicist Hugh Ross has put together a list of 122 constants that are absolutely essential for life on </span><span data-contrast="auto">ANY</span><span data-contrast="auto"> planet in the universe! He also calculated the probability that these 122 constants would exist on any planet in the universe without a mind, or an intelligent </span><span data-contrast="auto">B</span><span data-contrast="auto">eing, behind it</span><span data-contrast="auto"> all</span><span data-contrast="auto">. His conclusion is that the chances that any planet on the universe can have all of these constants by chance</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">is 0 followed by 138 zeros</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and a 1</span><span data-contrast="auto">, which is </span><span data-contrast="auto">obviously </span><span data-contrast="auto">close to impossible.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, moving on to another point, let us say that I create a table. I, as a human being, am I in the table? Am I bound by it? Am I controlled by it? No, I am beyond the table. In that specific example, I am outside my creation</span><span data-contrast="auto">, which is the table</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Now,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> let us </span><span data-contrast="auto">go back to the Big bang being the beginning of time, space, matter and energy. So let us use this point here as a reference for the singularity, whe</span><span data-contrast="auto">n</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the explosion happened. Right after this point, there is space, time, matter and energy. Right before this point, </span><span data-contrast="auto">if I can say that</span><span data-contrast="auto">, there is no space, no time, no matter and no energy. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Now, going back to my table example, I created the table and therefore </span><span data-contrast="auto">I</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">am </span><span data-contrast="auto">the one that caused it to be. I am its creator. I am beyond it. In the same way, the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Being </span><span data-contrast="auto">who </span><span data-contrast="auto">created this Big Bang, must </span><span data-contrast="auto">also </span><span data-contrast="auto">be beyond </span><span data-contrast="auto">the Big Bang</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (not bound by it)</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">He is its Creator. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So </span><span data-contrast="auto">let us</span><span data-contrast="auto"> now</span><span data-contrast="auto"> try to describe the characteristics of t</span><span data-contrast="auto">his Being</span><span data-contrast="auto">, He</span><span data-contrast="auto"> must be </span><span data-contrast="auto">first </span><span data-contrast="auto">beyond time</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (since He is beyond the Big Bang</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and the Big Bang was the beginning of time</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto">. And that </span><span data-contrast="auto">implies that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> He has no beginning </span><span data-contrast="auto">and no </span><span data-contrast="auto">end</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> since to have a beginning or end implies being under time. But since He is not bound by time, He has no beginning. He also must be </span><span data-contrast="auto">beyond space, beyond matter, </span><span data-contrast="auto">meaning </span><span data-contrast="auto">He is </span><span data-contrast="auto">immaterial or</span><span data-contrast="auto">, in other words, a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> spiritual</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Being</span><span data-contrast="auto">. He must also be</span><span data-contrast="auto"> beyond energy, He is the Cause and Source of this incredible energy. </span><span data-contrast="auto">In addition, based on the 122 Constants mentioned earlier</span><span data-contrast="auto"> demonstrating the precision of the </span><span data-contrast="auto">u</span><span data-contrast="auto">niverse</span><span data-contrast="auto">, this Being must be extremely intelligent.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">So this Being’s characteristics are: 1. Beyond time, meaning no beginning and no end, which implies eternity; 2. He is a spiritual Being; 3. He is extremely powerful because He caused this massive energy to exist; 4. He is extremely intelligent since the universe is very precise. Of course, this Being has more characteristics than this but we will stick to these ones in this video. Note</span><span data-contrast="auto"> also</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that </span><span data-contrast="auto">as</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Christian</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we speak </span><span data-contrast="auto">of </span><span data-contrast="auto">eternal life with God. </span><span data-contrast="auto">It is very probable that this eternal life will be spent with Him </span><span data-contrast="auto">beyond</span><span data-contrast="auto"> time, </span><span data-contrast="auto">beyond </span><span data-contrast="auto">the Big Bang, if you will. So</span><span data-contrast="auto">, in heaven, </span><span data-contrast="auto">it will not be the year 5400</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for example</span><span data-contrast="auto">. We will be with Him beyond time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The fascinating bit for me is how the Church Fathers described God in the fourth century. It is fascinating because these Fathers lived at a time where the Aristotelian science prevailed. And Aristotle believed that the cosmos was a single eternal entity. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So to him, the universe always existed. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Scientists and philosophers at the time</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">did not understand </span><span data-contrast="auto">that the Creator </span><span data-contrast="auto">is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> beyond time </span><span data-contrast="auto">and</span><span data-contrast="auto"> matter</span><span data-contrast="auto">. No</span><span data-contrast="auto">r </span><span data-contrast="auto">did they understand that He </span><span data-contrast="auto">created the universe from nothing. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Again, since t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he science of the time </span><span data-contrast="auto">assumed</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">that the universe always existed, then</span><span data-contrast="auto">, it made sense that </span><span data-contrast="auto">there was no creation out of nothing. </span><span data-contrast="auto">There was neither a moment where there was no time </span><span data-contrast="auto">or</span><span data-contrast="auto"> matter. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Yet, during this time St. Gregory the Theologian believed otherwise… in </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Liturgy attributed to </span><span data-contrast="auto">him, he spells </span><span data-contrast="auto">ou</span><span data-contrast="auto">t</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for us </span><span data-contrast="auto">some </span><span data-contrast="auto">of God’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">characteristics</span><span data-contrast="auto">, he </span><span data-contrast="auto">says</span><span data-contrast="auto">: </span><span data-contrast="auto">“It is fitting indeed and right, that we praise You, bless You, serve You, worship You and glorify You, the one, only true God, the lover of Mankind… </span><span data-contrast="auto">[then he mentions God’s characteristics] </span><span data-contrast="auto">ineffable, </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">invisible</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> (implying God is spiritual)</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">infinite, without beginning, everlasting, timeless</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> (all of those imply being beyond time)</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">, immeasurable, incomprehensible, </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">unchangeable</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">creator of all</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">, savior of everyone…”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> These characteristics fit exactly what science </span><span data-contrast="auto">teaches</span><span data-contrast="auto"> us through the Big Bang.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Note also that the above characteristics answer the question ‘who created God?’ You can find the answer to this question in </span><span data-contrast="auto">another</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">video which we will put the link to in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">comments section below. Going back to the Fathers, </span><span data-contrast="auto">St. Athanasius as well, who lived also in </span><span data-contrast="auto">the fourth century surprises us with a beautiful passage in his book On the Incarnation </span><span data-contrast="auto">section</span><span data-contrast="auto"> 2, he says: </span><span data-contrast="auto">“Others take the view expressed by Plato, that giant among the Greeks. He said that God had made all things out of pre-existent and </span><span data-contrast="auto">uncreated matter, just as the carpenter makes things only out of wood that already exists. But those who hold this view do not realise that to deny that God is Himself the </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">Cause of matter</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> is to impute limitation to Him, just as it is undoubtedly a limitation on the part of the carpenter that he can make nothing unless he has the wood. How could God be called Maker and Artificer if His ability to make depended on some other cause, namely on matter itself? If He only worked up existing matter and did not Himself bring matter into being, He would be not the Creator but only a craftsman.” St. Athanasius truly was against the world, not only in defending </span><span data-contrast="auto">the true faith against Arius but also in redirecting the science </span><span data-contrast="auto">and philosophy </span><span data-contrast="auto">of his time to the knowledge of the truth based on the revelation of Jesus Christ. It took science fifteen more centuries to </span><span data-contrast="auto">converge to St. Athanasius</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and St. Gregory</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> conclusion</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
