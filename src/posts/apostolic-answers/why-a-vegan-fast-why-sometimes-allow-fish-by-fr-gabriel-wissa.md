<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why a Vegan Fast? Why sometimes allow fish?</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have </span><span data-contrast="auto">seen in our previous </span><span data-contrast="auto">two </span><span data-contrast="auto">videos on fasting</span><span data-contrast="auto"> why fasting is essential </span><span data-contrast="auto">for a Christian. W</span><span data-contrast="auto">e </span><span data-contrast="auto">have also seen </span><span data-contrast="auto">how fasting must </span><span data-contrast="auto">be </span><span data-contrast="auto">both a spiritual and </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">bodily exercise. Today, we </span><span data-contrast="auto">dive</span><span data-contrast="auto"> into </span><span data-contrast="auto">the question of </span><span data-contrast="auto">why</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Orthodox Church </span><span data-contrast="auto">practices </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">vegan </span><span data-contrast="auto">fast</span><span data-contrast="auto">?</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Why </span><span data-contrast="auto">can’t </span><span data-contrast="auto">each one</span> <span data-contrast="auto">simply</span><span data-contrast="auto"> choose</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to abstain from foods </span><span data-contrast="auto">we</span> <span data-contrast="auto">enjoy</span><span data-contrast="auto">? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As we have seen in the previous videos</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Christian fasting is distinct from the fasting of other religions</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Christ, Himself, fasted and through His fasting He conquered </span><span data-contrast="auto">the devil’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">temptations. Christ, Himself, did not need to fast as He</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is God and</span><span data-contrast="auto"> cannot sin. </span><span data-contrast="auto">But He did so </span><span data-contrast="auto">in the mystery of His incarnation, </span><span data-contrast="auto">as the </span><span data-contrast="auto">God-Man</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to </span><span data-contrast="auto">infuse </span><span data-contrast="auto">human nature with </span><span data-contrast="auto">power to </span><span data-contrast="auto">conquer </span><span data-contrast="auto">temptation and </span><span data-contrast="auto">sin. </span><span data-contrast="auto">As He fasted and conquered in His human nature, we too</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">as</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we share this same human nature and are members of His </span><span data-contrast="auto">Body</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through Baptism</span><span data-contrast="auto">, we</span><span data-contrast="auto"> have access to that </span><span data-contrast="auto">power</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in fasting</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So when Christians fast, we fast in Christ.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">And therefore, that fast hol</span><span data-contrast="auto">d</span><span data-contrast="auto">s a certain </span><span data-contrast="auto">mysterious divine power</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through which we can conquer sin and be transformed from glory to glory in</span><span data-contrast="auto">to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the </span><span data-contrast="auto">image </span><span data-contrast="auto">of God</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">In other words, fasting is a tool to become saints. It is a tool to go back </span><span data-contrast="auto">to our pre-fallen human nature before Adam and Eve sinned</span><span data-contrast="auto">—b</span><span data-contrast="auto">efore </span><span data-contrast="auto">the state of </span><span data-contrast="auto">corruption and death. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And that is precisely what salvation is in the Orthodox Church. St. Athanasius says: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">… for the first fact that you must grasp is this: the renewal of creation has been wrought by the Self-same Word Who made it in the beginning. There is thus no inconsistency between creation and salvation.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> In other words, salvation is </span><span data-contrast="auto">synonymous with </span><span data-contrast="auto">recreation. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Recreating humanity was Christ’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">primary</span><span data-contrast="auto"> work on earth</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Recreating humanity to its original state prior to sin</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and more</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">This is not some sort of metaphor or poetry, this is mystically what happens to </span><span data-contrast="auto">the members of the Body of Christ in the mysteries of the Church</span><span data-contrast="auto">. F</span><span data-contrast="auto">asting </span><span data-contrast="auto">is a</span><span data-contrast="auto">lso a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> tool that propels </span><span data-contrast="auto">us </span><span data-contrast="auto">towards this </span><span data-contrast="auto">recreation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in Christ</span><span data-contrast="auto">. That is why when we encounter those </span><span data-contrast="auto">true </span><span data-contrast="auto">saints who l</span><span data-contrast="auto">i</span><span data-contrast="auto">ve amongst us</span><span data-contrast="auto">, those</span> <span data-contrast="auto">who </span><span data-contrast="auto">undergo</span> <span data-contrast="auto">true mystical spiritual experiences</span><span data-contrast="auto">, without exception we discover that they live a true life of asceticism. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Therefore</span><span data-contrast="auto">, if our objective is to </span><span data-contrast="auto">go back to our pre-fallen human state</span><span data-contrast="auto">—to </span><span data-contrast="auto">be recreated again</span><span data-contrast="auto">—and </span><span data-contrast="auto">this happens through the mysteries and through fasting, then we ought to </span><span data-contrast="auto">have</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the same </span><span data-contrast="auto">diet</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the first humans had. It is clear from </span><span data-contrast="auto">verses like Genesis 1:29, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Genesis 2:9 &amp; 2:16</span> <span data-contrast="auto">that the first humans were vegan. It is also clear</span><span data-contrast="auto"> from Genesis 9:3 that</span> <span data-contrast="auto">God allowed the eating of animals </span><span data-contrast="auto">only after the flood. </span><span data-contrast="auto">A that point in </span><span data-contrast="auto">history</span><span data-contrast="auto">, humanity had reached a very depraved state. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Therefore, t</span><span data-contrast="auto">his was a concession </span><span data-contrast="auto">from</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Go</span><span data-contrast="auto">d’s end</span> <span data-contrast="auto">as a way of dealing with </span><span data-contrast="auto">humanity’s depravity.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">He was willing to change His Laws to accommodate them since </span><span data-contrast="auto">they </span><span data-contrast="auto">would </span><span data-contrast="auto">have </span><span data-contrast="auto">not been able to keep His original standards</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">The Scholar Origen says the following: “… </span><span data-contrast="auto">originally God permitted the use of foods from vegetation, that is, vegetables and the fruits of trees. But the opportunity of eating flesh is given to men later when a covenant was made with Noah after the flood.” </span><span data-contrast="auto">In </span><span data-contrast="auto">simpler terms</span><span data-contrast="auto">, a human</span><span data-contrast="auto"> being in the pre-fallen condition </span><span data-contrast="auto">was spirit, soul and body. Humans, then, were led by the spirit</span><span data-contrast="auto">. They were </span><span data-contrast="auto">embodied spirits as St. Athanasius would say. </span><span data-contrast="auto">However, after the fall, this order was inversed and now </span><span data-contrast="auto">the bod</span><span data-contrast="auto">y is the one that is leading the soul and the spirit. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Therefore, fasting is a tool to bring back the proper order within the huma</span><span data-contrast="auto">n being</span><span data-contrast="auto">—to </span><span data-contrast="auto">recreate Him. To save Him. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And that is precisely why </span><span data-contrast="auto">during our fasts we completely abstain from food for a certain </span><span data-contrast="auto">period</span> <span data-contrast="auto">of time </span><span data-contrast="auto">and then we practice a vegan diet. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">here is </span><span data-contrast="auto">also </span><span data-contrast="auto">another </span><span data-contrast="auto">vital</span><span data-contrast="auto"> reason </span><span data-contrast="auto">for </span><span data-contrast="auto">human</span><span data-contrast="auto">ity</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s</span> <span data-contrast="auto">vegan</span> <span data-contrast="auto">diet. </span><span data-contrast="auto">On humanity</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in its pre-fallen condition</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> St. Gregory of Nyssa says the following: </span><span data-contrast="auto">“N</span><span data-contrast="auto">ature had not yet been divided; everything was completely fresh. Hunters did not capture prey, since people did not yet practice this. The beasts did not yet tear apart prey, since they were not meat eaters yet…. So was the first creation, and to this creation will be restored after this [age]. Humans will return to their original creation, rejecting hostility, a life encumbered with care, the slavery of the world to daily worries. Once they have renounced all this, they will return to that utopian life which is not enslaved to the passions of the flesh, which is freedom, the closeness to God, a partaker of the life of the angels.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> So beautiful. He says that </span><span data-contrast="auto">the creation will be restored at the end of times. </span><span data-contrast="auto">No more passions of the flesh. No more </span><span data-contrast="auto">separation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> from God but a utopian life</span><span data-contrast="auto">;</span><span data-contrast="auto"> humans will become partakers of the life of the angels. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And that </span><span data-contrast="auto">pre-fallen </span><span data-contrast="auto">utopian life did not include animal slaughter. There was no killing. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And since Orthodox Christianity aims at restoration while being still on </span><span data-contrast="auto">earth,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we ought to </span><span data-contrast="auto">keep away from slaughtering, at least during fasting seasons.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">We have to comprehend that h</span><span data-contrast="auto">umans are the crown of the creation</span><span data-contrast="auto">; yet, we </span><span data-contrast="auto">are still </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">part of that creation. There is truly something unnatural about killing an animal whether it is done for sport or for </span><span data-contrast="auto">consumption.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">We are not meant to kill and consume. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Humanity is</span><span data-contrast="auto">, in a sense, spiritually connected to the animal kingdom. And that is precisely what the word </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">subdue</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> means in Scripture. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><span data-contrast="auto">western </span><span data-contrast="auto">interpretation</span> <span data-contrast="auto">of th</span><span data-contrast="auto">e</span> <span data-contrast="auto">word </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">subdue</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span> <span data-contrast="auto">is that humans ought to </span><span data-contrast="auto">aggressively </span><span data-contrast="auto">subjugate</span> <span data-contrast="auto">the creation</span><span data-contrast="auto">. This </span><span data-contrast="auto">false </span><span data-contrast="auto">understanding leads</span> <span data-contrast="auto">to death, pollution and consumerism. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Again, t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he Orthodox understanding </span><span data-contrast="auto">is that the human being is mystically spiritually connected to the rest of creation. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And since humans are the crown of creation, we </span><span data-contrast="auto">are </span><span data-contrast="auto">responsible </span><span data-contrast="auto">to care </span><span data-contrast="auto">for the </span><span data-contrast="auto">creation. It has been given to </span><span data-contrast="auto">us</span><span data-contrast="auto"> by God as a responsibility. H</span><span data-contrast="auto">umanity has dominion over the creation, not to subjugate it</span><span data-contrast="auto">;</span><span data-contrast="auto"> but to </span><span data-contrast="auto">care for it.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To conclude this video, I will answer </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">follow-up question</span><span data-contrast="auto"> which natur</span><span data-contrast="auto">a</span><span data-contrast="auto">lly stems from the </span><span data-contrast="auto">previously</span><span data-contrast="auto">&#8211;</span><span data-contrast="auto">mentioned conclusion</span><span data-contrast="auto">s: i</span><span data-contrast="auto">f humans are meant to be vegan, why did Christ eat fish?</span><span data-contrast="auto"> The answer is quite simple. In His incarnation, Christ took on human</span><span data-contrast="auto"> nature with all its weaknesses. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Again, He was incarnate to recreate this </span><span data-contrast="auto">fallen </span><span data-contrast="auto">human nature so He took it as it was. The only </span><span data-contrast="auto">caveat</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is that He did not sin. </span><span data-contrast="auto">As St. Gregory the theologian says</span><span data-contrast="auto">:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “The unassumed is the unhealed.” Meaning whatever Christ did not assume in </span><span data-contrast="auto">His humanity</span><span data-contrast="auto">, He did not heal. Or, in other words, He did not recreate. </span><span data-contrast="auto">In Oration 45, </span><span data-contrast="auto">St. Gregory says </span><span data-contrast="auto">the following </span><span data-contrast="auto">about Christ</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s humanity</span><span data-contrast="auto">: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">He was sent, but sent according to His Manhood, since He was hungry and thirsty and weary, and was distressed and wept, according to the Laws of human nature.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Christ was a real human in every sense of the word. And He embraced this including the human diet of the time</span><span data-contrast="auto"> which included fish</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">As </span><span data-contrast="auto">Christ </span><span data-contrast="auto">says in Matthew 5, He came </span><span data-contrast="auto">to fulfill the Law and the Prophets. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So, H</span><span data-contrast="auto">e came to fulfill the Old Testament requirements</span><span data-contrast="auto">, including respecting the food laws,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and establish new ones through </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">recreation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of humanity</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through the giving of the Holy Spirit</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">And it is precisely because Christ ate fish that the Church </span><span data-contrast="auto">allows sea food in certain secondary fasts. This is done out of compassion for th</span><span data-contrast="auto">e members of the Body that are still growing in the faith.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
