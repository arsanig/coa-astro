<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, One God, Amen. Although we are facing unprecedented circumstances, we can still benefit from the Holy week even from home. Do not just watch the Pascha as means of entertainment but benefit and grow from it. Make the journey to Golgotha your own personal journey while reciting and meditating the daily prayers relating to the events of the day.</p>
