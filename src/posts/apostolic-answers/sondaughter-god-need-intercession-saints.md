<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If I am the son/daughter of God, why do I need the intercession of the saints?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.</p>
<p>If God loves us why do we need to ask saints or others to pray on our behalf? Does He for example love St. Mary more than me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Remember my beloved, know your faith, live your faith, and Teach your faith.</strong></p>
