<p>In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God. Amen. How does the Lord Jesus Christ’s incarnation save the human being? How is it that somehow we as humans are saved because of the Lord’s becoming man and sharing in our human condition. If you have watched our previous video which was the first of this series on Salvation, you know that we’ve spoken about the mystery surrounding God’s divine economy of salvation. We’ve also spoken how there is no one single event in the Life of Christ that is responsible for our salvation, but rather the culmination of the entirety of the Christ’s life that brings healing and restoration to humanity’s fallen condition. #Coptic Orthodox Answers #COA #AA</p>
