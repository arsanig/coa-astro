<p>Are saints alive? Can they be in two places at once? Can they hear us? </p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.  </p>
<p>Regarding the intercession of the saints, the following questions are sometimes a stumbling block to some: how can the saints hear us? Are they even alive? How can a Greek speaking saint letâ€™s say understand me if I am talking to him in English? How can a saint be here in there simultaneously? Meaning how can he or she respond to several different people on different continents and all at the same time? These are sound questions and the answer is simpler than most realize.  </p>
