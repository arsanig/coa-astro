<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.</p>
<p>Why was Christ incarnate on earth only 2000 years ago? Humanity prior to the incarnation was in desperate need of a Savior, humans were corrupt and times were dark; so why did He not come to save humanity earlier? Why wait till then? Today, we aim to answer these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As Christians, w</span><span data-contrast="auto">e understand that salvation </span><span data-contrast="auto">is retroactive</span><span data-contrast="auto">, meaning it applies</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to all humans before the incarnation</span><span data-contrast="auto">/cross/resurrection</span><span data-contrast="auto">. It also applies to everyone after the incarnation. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We also know that t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he timing of the Messiah</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s coming</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">is </span><span data-contrast="auto">evident</span><span data-contrast="auto"> from </span><span data-contrast="auto">Daniel’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">prophec</span><span data-contrast="auto">y</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">chapter </span><span data-contrast="auto">7</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we know that </span><span data-contrast="auto">the timing </span><span data-contrast="auto">is not haphazard</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">But </span><span data-contrast="auto">why did God ch</span><span data-contrast="auto">o</span><span data-contrast="auto">ose this </span><span data-contrast="auto">specific </span><span data-contrast="auto">time?</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">If humans were suffering and dying, why did He not come earlier? </span><span data-contrast="auto">The assumption that is made when people ask this question </span><span data-contrast="auto">is that God can do everything</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and since He can do everything He should have come earlier</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">That is not totally true</span><span data-contrast="auto"> though</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">God cannot do everything. </span><span data-contrast="auto">For example, </span><span data-contrast="auto">God cannot sin. He cannot lie, He cannot get angry, He cannot </span><span data-contrast="auto">do evil, etc. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> although we say that God is Almighty, it does not necessarily mean that He can do eve</span><span data-contrast="auto">rything.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> God, being Almighty, will </span><span data-contrast="auto">ultimately</span><span data-contrast="auto"> overcome evil</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and bring Life</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to whomever chooses to be His child</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">But</span><span data-contrast="auto">, i</span><span data-contrast="auto">s there </span><span data-contrast="auto">still </span><span data-contrast="auto">evil in the world today? Certainly. </span><span data-contrast="auto">It is everywhere and increasing. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Is there </span><span data-contrast="auto">poverty in the world? Definitely. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Why is that?</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Does God will evil and poverty? Of course not.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> However, these exist</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">b</span><span data-contrast="auto">ecause of humanity’s free will. </span><span data-contrast="auto">God</span><span data-contrast="auto">, being Love, </span><span data-contrast="auto">has to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> give humans a free will to </span><span data-contrast="auto">choose to </span><span data-contrast="auto">love Him back. And that free will, </span><span data-contrast="auto">given </span><span data-contrast="auto">in His </span><span data-contrast="auto">l</span><span data-contrast="auto">ove and </span><span data-contrast="auto">h</span><span data-contrast="auto">umility, </span><span data-contrast="auto">He does not intervene with. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">if I choose to not walk in God’s path, </span><span data-contrast="auto">God Almighty</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">cannot force me</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The problem with asking why </span><span data-contrast="auto">was </span><span data-contrast="auto">God </span><span data-contrast="auto">not</span><span data-contrast="auto"> incarnate earlier presumes that </span><span data-contrast="auto">it was all up to Him. </span><span data-contrast="auto">That it was His choice and His choice only. But that is certainly not the case. </span><span data-contrast="auto">God works in synergy with humanity. He works with us. And, we</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">more often than not</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> delay God’s work. </span><span data-contrast="auto">In reality, if</span><span data-contrast="auto"> it was up to God alone, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Adam and Eve would have not sinned, </span><span data-contrast="auto">there would be no Cain killing Abel, there would be no tower of Babel.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> No evil.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> All of these </span><span data-contrast="auto">are consequences of humanity’s free will. Yet, out of His love, God </span><span data-contrast="auto">still wants</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to save </span><span data-contrast="auto">us</span><span data-contrast="auto"> but He is stuck working with this </span><span data-contrast="auto">reckless </span><span data-contrast="auto">humanit</span><span data-contrast="auto">y</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">S</span><span data-contrast="auto">o</span><span data-contrast="auto"> He does the best He can </span><span data-contrast="auto">through</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">us</span><span data-contrast="auto">! </span><span data-contrast="auto">Again, He does the best He can through us. </span><span data-contrast="auto">He is stuck with us and we delay Him all the time.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> In other words, the </span><span data-contrast="auto">salvific plan </span><span data-contrast="auto">would be easy</span><span data-contrast="auto">, or</span><span data-contrast="auto"> speedy</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> if </span><span data-contrast="auto">it was all up to God. But since it is not all up to Him because we are in the picture, th</span><span data-contrast="auto">e</span><span data-contrast="auto">n</span><span data-contrast="auto"> it gets much more complicated. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Not that it gets complicated for God as He foreknows all this, but </span><span data-contrast="auto">it gets complicated for us to comprehend. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So, </span><span data-contrast="auto">God is trying to speedily run </span><span data-contrast="auto">to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> our </span><span data-contrast="auto">salvation, but He is being </span><span data-contrast="auto">continually </span><span data-contrast="auto">delayed by </span><span data-contrast="auto">humans </span><span data-contrast="auto">who are pulling Him back. </span><span data-contrast="auto">But </span><span data-contrast="auto">again, </span><span data-contrast="auto">God is not surprised by that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at all</span><span data-contrast="auto">. God </span><span data-contrast="auto">foreknows our own decisions a</span><span data-contrast="auto">nd since He </span><span data-contrast="auto">foreknows</span><span data-contrast="auto"> He chose the appropriate time for the incarnation. </span><span data-contrast="auto">If you would like to understand God’s foreknowledge</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">you can click</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">on </span><span data-contrast="auto">the video link in the comments section below</span><span data-contrast="auto"> after watching this video</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> having understood </span><span data-contrast="auto">that the salvific plan is </span><span data-contrast="auto">greatly </span><span data-contrast="auto">affected </span><span data-contrast="auto">by </span><span data-contrast="auto">humans, </span><span data-contrast="auto">it is </span><span data-contrast="auto">worthy to note </span><span data-contrast="auto">some of the </span><span data-contrast="auto">elements</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that affect</span><span data-contrast="auto">ed</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the </span><span data-contrast="auto">incarnation’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">timing</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">It is important to </span><span data-contrast="auto">mention</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that a complete answer to this question would require a full understanding of his</span><span data-contrast="auto">tory itself and therefore</span><span data-contrast="auto"> would require</span><span data-contrast="auto"> someone that witnessed it</span><span data-contrast="auto"> all</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">And, si</span><span data-contrast="auto">nce no human </span><span data-contrast="auto">will ever fit this trait</span><span data-contrast="auto">, we </span><span data-contrast="auto">have to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> resort to </span><span data-contrast="auto">be content </span><span data-contrast="auto">with some interesting facts about the timing</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">chosen by God</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The</span><span data-contrast="auto"> first </span><span data-contrast="auto">fact</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">is the influence of the Greek Philosophers. At a time when humanity believed in polytheism, each nation praying to their own gods, the Greek philosophers shifted that ideology to the belief in One God. Plato believed in a supreme </span><span data-contrast="auto">diety</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Aristotle believed in a Grand Designer or an Unmoved Mover, the Stoics believed in the Logos, a Mind that rules the universe. These philosophers introduced the possibility of monotheism</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to the world</span><span data-contrast="auto">—the belief in one God. It is in this context that The Son of God was incarnate. </span><span data-contrast="auto">A</span><span data-contrast="auto"> second point is centered around the fact that God was incarnate to recreate </span><span data-contrast="auto">humanity. And, by the same token, He has given humanity an ultimate level of morality to live by. This morality is exemplified in the Sermon on the Mount in the gospel of Matthew chapters 5 to 7. One of the purposes of the incarnation is therefore to shift the level of human morality from the time of the flood </span><span data-contrast="auto">in the book of Genesis </span><span data-contrast="auto">when all the thoughts of all humans were continually evil to the general Old Testament state where humanity is still growing </span><span data-contrast="auto">bit by bit </span><span data-contrast="auto">till the time when God saw it fit to become </span><span data-contrast="auto">M</span><span data-contrast="auto">an and to teach humanity the ultimate morality. This exemplified morality could not have been accepted by humanity in prior times as we were not ready to receive it. And this is precisely why God gave humanity the Old Testament Law of ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ It was not because God’s own morality was different back then. Of course, not. It was because humanity could not accept the level of the New Testament morality. But once again, the time to shift human perception had come.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">third</span><span data-contrast="auto"> item is the Greek Language. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Thanks to Alexander the Great</span><span data-contrast="auto">, Greek was the common language </span><span data-contrast="auto">of the civili</span><span data-contrast="auto">z</span><span data-contrast="auto">ed </span><span data-contrast="auto">world</span><span data-contrast="auto">. At a time when Hebrew and Aramaic were spoken only in Palestine, Greek </span><span data-contrast="auto">was spoken in</span><span data-contrast="auto">ternationally including in</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the </span><span data-contrast="auto">R</span><span data-contrast="auto">oman empire</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Of course, a common language was essential to the spreading of the gospel. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Therefore, it is no surprise that the New Testament</span><span data-contrast="auto">, the Ecumenical Councils</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="auto">the majority of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Church Fathers</span><span data-contrast="auto"> used Greek as the </span><span data-contrast="auto">language of communication. </span><span data-contrast="auto">A fourth</span><span data-contrast="auto"> one is </span><span data-contrast="auto">the Pax Romana. Pax Romana </span><span data-contrast="auto">meaning “Roman Peace” was a period of relative </span><span data-contrast="auto">peace </span><span data-contrast="auto">that lasted for approximately 200 years, </span><span data-contrast="auto">which started during the reign of Augustus</span><span data-contrast="auto">, who was the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Caesar at the time of the incarnation. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he Pax Romana </span><span data-contrast="auto">made the Apostles’ missionary journeys a possibility</span><span data-contrast="auto">. It reduced the level of persecution faced by the Church</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and; therefore, it facilitated the spreading of the gospel. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another point</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is the presence of s</span><span data-contrast="auto">ome key </span><span data-contrast="auto">people</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">These</span><span data-contrast="auto"> had to be present </span><span data-contrast="auto">for Christendom to develop as it did. First, </span><span data-contrast="auto">through </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Father’s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">D</span><span data-contrast="auto">ivine </span><span data-contrast="auto">foreknowledge, </span><span data-contrast="auto">He</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">selected </span><span data-contrast="auto">the Virgin Mary</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to be the Son of God’s bearer</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> As we say in the Coptic Midnight Praises: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">The father looked </span><span data-contrast="auto">from heaven, and found</span><span data-contrast="auto"> no one like you</span><span data-contrast="auto">, He sent His only begotten, who came and took flesh from</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you</span><span data-contrast="auto">.” Of course, the Father is beyond time and He selected her </span><span data-contrast="auto">before </span><span data-contrast="auto">time began. She was worthy to be entrusted with the mystery of the incarnation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and to </span><span data-contrast="auto">rear</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Son of God in the flesh</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Note when Archangel Gabriel came to announce to her the birth of the Messiah in Luke 1</span><span data-contrast="auto">, she had to accept </span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto">e responsibility of the incarnation. She also has free will</span><span data-contrast="auto">. So, as soon as St. Mary said: &#8220;Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Archangel </span><span data-contrast="auto">departed</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Not only is she worthy of the mystery but she </span><span data-contrast="auto">was willing. </span><span data-contrast="auto">St. Irenaeus demonstrates how her obedience was a participation in </span><span data-contrast="auto">God’s salvific plan. He says: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">…</span><span data-contrast="auto">For as Eve was seduced by the word of an angel to flee from God, having rebelled against his Word, so Mary by the word of an angel received the glad tidings that she would bear God by obeying his Word. The former was seduced to disobey God and so fell, but the latter was persuaded to obey God, so </span><span data-contrast="auto">that the Virgin Mary might become the advocate of Eve. As </span><span data-contrast="auto">the human race</span><span data-contrast="auto"> was subjected to death through the act of a virgin, so was it saved by a virgin was precisely balanced by the obedience of another.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Her obedience was needed for our salvation. This ties back to the point made at the beginning of the video demonstrating that God’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">salvific plan</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is </span><span data-contrast="auto">affected by human decisions.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Similarly, St. John the Baptist was needed</span><span data-contrast="auto">. He was part of the plan and this can be seen </span><span data-contrast="auto">through his own words when he says: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” Again, the time is fulfilled, meaning </span><span data-contrast="auto">the time of salvation has come</span><span data-contrast="auto">. It is time to repent because the Kingdom of God </span><span data-contrast="auto">is near. He is truly the </span><span data-contrast="auto">voice crying in the wilderness preparing the </span><span data-contrast="auto">way of the Lord. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The same applies to St. Paul. St. Paul is truly a rare personality. A man with great zeal and commitment</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that is born a Jew and knows the Law inside out; yet, He is also a Roman citizen and </span><span data-contrast="auto">was well thought in the Greek language and culture. </span><span data-contrast="auto">All of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> these characteristics were absolutely essential to his evangelical mission.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> He too says about himself the following: “But when </span><span data-contrast="auto">it</span><span data-contrast="auto"> pleased God, who separated me from my mother&#8217;s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles…” He shows</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> here</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">his understanding that he was chosen by God before his birth. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The same could be said about St. Peter, St. John, St. Mark and all the Apostles. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> all of these points together demonstrate</span><span data-contrast="auto"> t</span><span data-contrast="auto">hat</span><span data-contrast="auto"> although humanity does limit the work of God, in His foreknowledge, God is still evidently able to </span><span data-contrast="auto">appropriately </span><span data-contrast="auto">time the incarnation. One specific event demonstrates this very well, which is when the darkness fell over the land during Christ’s crucifixion. St. Luke states this event in his gospel chapter 23, verses 44 through 46. </span><span data-contrast="auto">IF</span><span data-contrast="auto"> this event is indeed a solar eclipse as many believe, then, God demonstrates, here, His foreknowledge of </span><span data-contrast="auto">this eclipse</span><span data-contrast="auto"> 750 years prior to the event itself</span><span data-contrast="auto"> t</span><span data-contrast="auto">hrough the prophet Amos, </span><span data-contrast="auto">who wrote about the darkness </span><span data-contrast="auto">in his book chapter 8, verse 9. Therefore, the cross </span><span data-contrast="auto">is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> timed perfectly with the eclipse which created the darkness in Jerusalem. The fascinating part is that this event was also recorded by secular history. Julius Africanus who wrote in about 221 AD quotes another historian whose name is Thallus. Thallus wrote in 52 AD</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (so first century)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and he wrote the following: “On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down.  This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.” This event was recorded in both the Old and New Testaments as well as in secular history demonstrating that although God, in His love, chose to work with humans, and humans made things complicated as usual, He was still able to perfectly time his salvific work.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
