<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen.</p>
<p>Some opponents of the Christian faith will challenge us with an important question, one that is worth investigating. They will say “If you believe that Jesus is God, show us where He himself makes that declaration.” And the truth of the matter is, if we search out scripture for words spoken by Jesus saying “I am God”, you simply won’t find them in the Bible! And yet, Christians have believed that He is God for as long as Christians have existed! And so, we begin by making a bold declaration – we do not need that statement to be spoken by Christ and recorded in Scripture for us to know and believe that He is indeed the Son of the Living God – who is of one Essence with God the Father and the Holy Spirit!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now some may here this and think this is a copout – but it isn’t. You see, Holy Scripture provides so much evidence for the fact that the Lord Christ was indeed Divine. </span><span data-contrast="auto">There is also historical evidence that the early Church who was established by the apostles themselves also received the teaching that Jesus Christ is God. And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so</span><span data-contrast="auto"> if we examine these things, we will see that our faith does not hang on to a single sentence for us to know that He is indeed the God who became man. To begin, lets </span><span data-contrast="auto">take a look</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at what Scripture has to say. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> what does Holy Scripture reveal to us about the person of Jesus of Nazareth. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> begin with what the Lord Jesus Christ says himself. Here are </span><span data-contrast="auto">but a few of the many</span><span data-contrast="auto"> statements that the Lord declares that speak to His Divinity as God: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Lord Christ declares that God is His Father</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Now some may hear this and wonder why this is important. Well you see, it is of great importance because we must consider what </span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto">is meant at the time of Jesus. Today, many of us, and surely all Christians, do not shy away from calling God our Father. We all call ourselves Children of God. But you see, at the time of Jesus, to even speak God’s name was inexcusable. The proof of this is the reaction that Jews Had when the Lord declared that He was the Son of God</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and </span><span data-contrast="auto">professed</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that God was His Father. Let’s read together from John chapter 5. This text is taken up immediately after the Lord heals the man who had an ailment for 38 years. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><span data-contrast="auto">Lord heals him on the sabbath, and here is what happens next:  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">For this </span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">reason,</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto"> the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath. 17 But Jesus answered them, “My Father has been working until now, and I have been working.”</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">18 Therefore the Jews sought </span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">all the more</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto"> to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">”</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto"> (John 5:16-18)</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">You see, in this very text, Scripture declares that even the people of that time understood that His claim to </span><span data-contrast="auto">being</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Son of God was a declaration of </span><span data-contrast="auto">His </span><span data-contrast="auto">divinity.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> As St John the evangelist clear</span><span data-contrast="auto">ly</span><span data-contrast="auto"> mentions, </span><span data-contrast="auto">the </span><span data-contrast="auto">jews</span><span data-contrast="auto"> believed that he was making himself “equal with God”. And so, whoever is equal with God, was declaring himself to be divine! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s look at another example of what Jesus Says. In John chapter 10 verse 30, the Lord makes an extremely bold statement, He says: “I and my Father are One.”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">A</span><span data-contrast="auto">gain, we can understand how powerful this statement is </span><span data-contrast="auto">unless we</span><span data-contrast="auto"> look at the reaction of the crowd around Jesus</span><span data-contrast="auto"> after He said it</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Let</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">s see what scripture tells us happens next: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">“</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him. 32 Jesus answered them, “Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?”</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">33 The Jews answered Him, saying, “For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God.”</span></i></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto"> (John 10: 31-33)</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet again my beloved, it is obvious from this text that even the Jesus who heard Him speak did not need him to say the words “I am God”, because clearly they themselves understand that all that he was sating and doing was openly declaring that He is God.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Furthermore, its is clear in the life of Christ, that not only his words, but His actions manifest that He is God. This is seen very clearly in the fact that Jesus demonstrates that He has the attributes that belong to God alone!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now while scripture is of great importance in identifying what we believe as Christians, so </span><span data-contrast="auto">also</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we ought to turn to what the Church has been teaching in both oral and written tradition since the </span><span data-contrast="auto">birth</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of the Church in the very first century. And so, lets </span><span data-contrast="auto">take a look</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at what the early Church taught about the divinity of Jesus Christ. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the earliest Church Fathers, St Ignatius </span><span data-contrast="auto">of Antioch, served as a bishop in the first century. St Ignatius wrote many epistles of which we still have access to today. In his writings, he refers to the Lord Jesus Christ as God. For instance, let us examine how he himself opens with a greeting in a letter to the Ephesians:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Notice how he does not shy away from saying that Jesus Christ is “Our God”! And again, this is from an early church Father who lived in the very first century and received his faith from the apostles. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another Early Church Father and considered to be a Theologian, is St Gregory of Nazianzus. The Coptic Orthodox Church will often celebrate the Divine Liturgy by using the Anaphora that he wrote. Listen to the following excerpt that is taken from the Liturgy of St Gregory: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Again, St Gregory like St Ignatius before him, boldly proclaims that Jesus, who condescended and became man, was indeed God!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">I suppose the earliest and greatest witness of what Christians believed after the life of Christ comes from the great apostle Paul. After his conversion, he preached the gospel to many nations, and I believe that one of the most explicit and clearest statements of the divinity of Christ was spoken by him. Let us read together from Paul’s epistle to the Colossians: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}" data-wac-het="1"> </span></p>
