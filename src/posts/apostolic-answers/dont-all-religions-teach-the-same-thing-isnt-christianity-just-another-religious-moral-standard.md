<p><span data-contrast="auto">Don’t all religions </span><span data-contrast="auto">basically </span><span data-contrast="auto">teach the same thing? </span><span data-contrast="auto">Aren’t they all just different expressions of how people ought to love one another, chose peace, justice, mercy, and </span><span data-contrast="auto">all that other good stuff? And i</span><span data-contrast="auto">sn’t Christianity just </span><span data-contrast="auto">one of the many </span><span data-contrast="auto">religious moral standard</span><span data-contrast="auto">s that exist</span><span data-contrast="auto">?</span> <span data-contrast="auto">My beloved, these are some of the arguments that many have made in effort to dilute the salvific message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to simply </span><span data-contrast="auto">reduce</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Christian faith into nothing more than a set of morals, </span><span data-contrast="auto">ethics</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and principles. Its is </span><span data-contrast="auto">absolutely crucial</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for us to know that we as Orthodox Christians are in no way interested in associating ourselves to religious moralism – what we are pursuing is </span><span data-contrast="auto">Him</span><span data-contrast="auto"> who is THE WAY, the </span><span data-contrast="auto">THE</span><span data-contrast="auto"> TRUTH, and THE LIFE. God the Father did not patiently toil with humanity for thousands of years so they could learn to be nice. Our Lord and God Jesus Christ did not die on the cross and rise from the dead so that we could learn to be good boys and girls. The Holy Spirit was not sent to dwell in us so that we can simply be viewed as good moral citizens…no! The message of salvation found with</span><span data-contrast="auto">in</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the Christian faith is one that leads to </span><span data-contrast="auto">eternal </span><span data-contrast="auto">life in and with God! It is the very solution to humanity’s fallenness, corruption and death! And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so</span><span data-contrast="auto"> everything we do is meant to lead to </span><span data-contrast="auto">e</span><span data-contrast="auto">ternal life – not some set of righteous moral standards. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now </span><span data-contrast="auto">we’ve</span><span data-contrast="auto"> heard that all religions supposedly say the same thing. And even some atheists, who </span><span data-contrast="auto">don’t</span><span data-contrast="auto"> believe in God, will even say that Jesus wasn’t a messiah as much as he was an incredible moral teacher. But let me ask you, for those of us who have </span><span data-contrast="auto">studies the religious worldviews that exist out there</span><span data-contrast="auto">, what other religious groups, or even what kind of </span><span data-contrast="auto">supposed “</span><span data-contrast="auto">good moral teacher</span><span data-contrast="auto">s”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> would say the following: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved it is </span><span data-contrast="auto">so blatantly obvious from the teachings our Lord Jesus Christ which we find in scripture that the Divine economy of Salvation is concerned primarily with this: Human</span><span data-contrast="auto">ity</span><span data-contrast="auto"> vivified in and through the knowledge of the one true God. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The Lord Jesus was not a moral teacher like many others </span><span data-contrast="auto">that came </span><span data-contrast="auto">before and after him</span><span data-contrast="auto">. He was not</span><span data-contrast="auto"> concerned with manners and morals</span><span data-contrast="auto"> &#8211; </span><span data-contrast="auto">He </span><span data-contrast="auto">is the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> incarnate Word of God, who came to make known to us the Holy Trinity</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">who came to save us from the tyranny of death and offer us life eternal! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In one of the most important Early Church texts called On the Incarnation, St Athanasius of Alexandria explains </span><span data-contrast="auto">precisely why the Logos of God – the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Eternal Word and Son of the Father – came and took flesh. He goes into </span><span data-contrast="auto">great detail</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to explain </span><span data-contrast="auto">that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the effects of the fall on humanity were existential. By introducing sin into the world, we introduced death. And death ruled over us as a tyrant from whose grip humanity could not break free. We are not merely speaking of biological death which we all continue to experience, but rather eternal death – where the human being continues </span><span data-contrast="auto">eternally</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in a state or corruption and separation from God under the bondage of death. </span><span data-contrast="auto">St Athanasius therefore explains that Christ came to solve </span><span data-contrast="auto">that which</span><span data-contrast="auto"> humanity could not do for itself – he came and destroyed death and opened again for us the path that leads to eternal life in Him. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
