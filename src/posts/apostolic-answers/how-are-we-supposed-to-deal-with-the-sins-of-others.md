<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, One God, Amen.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to deal with the sins of others? What should be the Christian response to another person’s trespass or failing? My beloved, this might seem like an easy question to answer: some might simply say ‘God is love and so we ought to love one another’. Or ‘we ought to forgive as God has forgiven us’… And while this may be true, I would like to argue that it’s only seemingly easy in theory. Because at the practical level of our lives, we really are no good at all in dealing with one another when we sin.</p>
