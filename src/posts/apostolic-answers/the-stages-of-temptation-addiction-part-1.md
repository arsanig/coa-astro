<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Church often teaches us that within our spiritual life, there will be warfare. And if warfare, then there must be an enemy. And if an enemy, then we are under attack. If you have ever wondered what these attacks look like, and how we are tempted to sin, then stick around and let’s look at the six stages that lead to temptation, sin, and addiction. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, One God, Amen. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">My beloved we have often been taught that the devil is the greatest adversary of mankind. Constantly trying to make </span><span data-contrast="auto">us</span><span data-contrast="auto"> fall in his traps, wanting us to </span><span data-contrast="auto">distance ourselves from God and in so doing, giving ourselves over entirely to the slavery of sin and the passions. St. P</span><span data-contrast="auto">e</span><span data-contrast="auto">ter describes this very warfare by wa</span><span data-contrast="auto">r</span><span data-contrast="auto">ning us that we must “</span><span data-contrast="auto">Be sober, be vigilant; because </span><span data-contrast="auto">your</span><span data-contrast="auto"> adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” (1 Peter 5:8)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">And so, it is only befitting for us, if we are to battle valiantly in our daily spiritual warfare, to take the time and study the tactics used by the devil in his attempts to make us fall. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now the Church has done a great deal to help equip us for the battles we face when fighting </span><span data-contrast="auto">f</span><span data-contrast="auto">or our salvation. She has given to us the holy and divine mysteries as the greatest source of strength, she has made accessible to us the tools required to build a virtuous life, and she has opened her arms wide with compassion to welcome us no matter how often we fall. And among those things that the Church offers us, is the </span><span data-contrast="auto">centuries of spiritual experience that her saints have accumulated and left behind for us in the teachings on spiritual warfare. Today we will discuss some of these teachings </span><span data-contrast="auto">that were left for us by </span><span data-contrast="auto">many of those who successfully fought before us </span><span data-contrast="auto">and have succeeded in the spiritual race. </span><span data-contrast="auto">In this </span><span data-contrast="auto">two-part</span><span data-contrast="auto"> series, w</span><span data-contrast="auto">e </span><span data-contrast="auto">will </span><span data-contrast="auto">seek to understand what are the stages of temptation that lead to sin and addiction in our lives. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for this first video, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s go ahead and take a deeper look at </span><span data-contrast="auto">the first three stages </span><span data-contrast="auto">of temptation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> than can lead to addiction.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The first stage that we experience when we are tempted is called “Provocation” or “Bait”. Now this p</span><span data-contrast="auto">rovocation </span><span data-contrast="auto">can be as simple as a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> word or </span><span data-contrast="auto">an</span><span data-contrast="auto"> image which appears in the heart without your consent. It appears in the mind as a simple possibility.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Now this thing that provokes us, that seeks our attention</span><span data-contrast="auto"> seems to be outside of us; we didn't create it.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> For instance, i</span><span data-contrast="auto">t </span><span data-contrast="auto">can be a </span><span data-contrast="auto">simple thought of a possible sinful deed, </span><span data-contrast="auto">but at this point, we have not </span><span data-contrast="auto">allowed the thought to fully develop - it is merely teasing us</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or trying to bait us as the name says. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Think for instance</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a person who goes fishing - see the image here. The </span><span data-contrast="auto">person who goes fishing</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will attach a worm or a prop of some sort to the fishing hook </span><span data-contrast="auto">in an attempt to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> make a fish think that food is ready to be consumed. </span><span data-contrast="auto">When in reality, </span><span data-contrast="auto">what</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">the poor fish doesn’t realize</span><span data-contrast="auto">, is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that this bait is attached to </span><span data-contrast="auto">a sharp</span><span data-contrast="auto"> metal hook </span><span data-contrast="auto">which will pierce right through it, and</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will be used to reel it in.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now at this point, the person who has been provoked or baited has not committed any sin! </span><span data-contrast="auto">The bait, the provocation, isn't yet sin</span><span data-contrast="auto">ful</span><span data-contrast="auto"> because it d</span><span data-contrast="auto">id</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">not</span><span data-contrast="auto"> depend on us to produce it</span><span data-contrast="auto">. And </span><span data-contrast="auto">so</span><span data-contrast="auto"> every person is subject to this first step - all of humanity is provoked and baited by Satan in an attempt to pull us into a state of sin.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now it seems right for us to ask what are we typically baited with? </span><span data-contrast="auto">From this it follows that Satan sends the bait to us by means of the bodily appetites; </span><span data-contrast="auto">our thoughts, memories, an image through our eyes, a word through our ears, and even a scent that we small afar off. All of these and many more bodily functions can be </span><span data-contrast="auto">used to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">stir up some appetite which is sleeping in the subconscious</span><span data-contrast="auto"> o</span><span data-contrast="auto">f the human person. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">St John </span><span data-contrast="auto">Climacus </span><span data-contrast="auto">explains just how quickly such a provocation can come upon us. Listen to how he describes it: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">What happens is this. In a moment, without a word being</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">spoken or an image </span><span data-contrast="auto">presented</span><span data-contrast="auto">, a sudden passionate urge lays hold of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">the victim. It comes faster than </span><span data-contrast="auto">anything</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in the physical world and is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">swifter and more indiscernible than any spirit. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">It makes its appearance</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">in the soul by a simple memory, which is unconnected with </span><span data-contrast="auto">anything</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">independent of time and inexpressible, and in some cases</span><span data-contrast="auto"> co</span><span data-contrast="auto">mes without</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">the person him self realizing the fact. Someone who</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">has been able to detect such a subtlety, someone with the gift of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">mourning, may be able to explain how with the eye </span><span data-contrast="auto">alone</span><span data-contrast="auto">, with a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">mere glance, by the touch of a hand, through a song overheard, the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">soul </span><span data-contrast="auto">is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> led to commit a definite sin of unchastity without any notion</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">or evil thought.</span><span data-contrast="auto">” [John </span><span data-contrast="auto">Climacus </span><span data-contrast="auto">- The Ladder of Divine Ascent] </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What St. John is describing is nothing short of a trap that is set. We have been baited - like that fish in the water, we see what look like something appetizing, but it is truly bait that attempts to lure us in. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now the second stage is that of disturbance. In this stage, </span><span data-contrast="auto">after we have been provoked, we experience a </span><span data-contrast="auto">momentary disturbance of the </span><span data-contrast="auto">heart or the </span><span data-contrast="auto">intellect. The suggestion</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">has been </span><span data-contrast="auto">thrown at us</span><span data-contrast="auto">, we’ve been provoked, and we’re briefly aware that something has happened within us</span><span data-contrast="auto">. T</span><span data-contrast="auto">his suggestion, this thought, has touched us. We become aware of that!</span><span data-contrast="auto"> And so, because we a</span><span data-contrast="auto">re aware that we’ve been provided an opportunity</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to potentially sin</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">we also realize that we can </span><span data-contrast="auto">either follow </span><span data-contrast="auto">this through </span><span data-contrast="auto">into sin or to resist</span><span data-contrast="auto"> it</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Now again, its important to note that just like in the first stage of provocation, a</span><span data-contrast="auto">t this stage</span><span data-contrast="auto"> also </span><span data-contrast="auto">there is still no active sin on our part. What we’ve experienced is only the suggestion to sin and the mental awareness of its possibility. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that being said, w</span><span data-contrast="auto">hat</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we do next is critical: </span><span data-contrast="auto">we will either </span><span data-contrast="auto">remain without sin or allow ourselves to fall</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And </span><span data-contrast="auto">this</span><span data-contrast="auto"> brings us to the third stage: called </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">coupling</span><span data-contrast="auto">” or “mingling”</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Coupling is </span><span data-contrast="auto">when we have given our attention over to </span><span data-contrast="auto">what has provoked</span><span data-contrast="auto"> us</span><span data-contrast="auto">! </span><span data-contrast="auto">This is when we pause for a moment and consider what is happening to us. We typically take a closer look at what is being presented to our heart and our mind. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Still, this state is </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">sometimes</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> not sinful. The decisive moment is when our thought takes a position</span><span data-contrast="auto">: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If we have rejected the thought </span><span data-contrast="auto">once we’ve identified it as potentially sinful</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">then </span><span data-contrast="auto">we have escaped</span><span data-contrast="auto"> by God’s grace. </span><span data-contrast="auto">If, however, we start to think about it, to relish the </span><span data-contrast="auto">idea</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in our mind, the &#8220;coupling&#8221; or the </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">mingling</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of our thoughts with </span><span data-contrast="auto">that which is demonic and sinful</span><span data-contrast="auto"> has already happened.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> It is when we have done the later that </span><span data-contrast="auto">we have joined ourselves with the evil thought; it has become part of us. By it we have entered the </span><span data-contrast="auto">state of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> sin and we can hardly stop the full development of this process once it is set in motion.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">And while here we discuss these </span><span data-contrast="auto">three </span><span data-contrast="auto">stages in depth,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and we take our time to discuss and understand them</span><span data-contrast="auto">, in reality,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> these</span><span data-contrast="auto"> actually happen within the person so very quickly - milliseconds even!</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Hence why we need to study this process carefully </span><span data-contrast="auto">in an attempt to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> prevent our falling into sin. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now we have seen the first three of six stages of temptation that can lead to a fully developed passion and addiction. God willing, in our second part of this series, we will review the other three stages: Assent, Captivity, and Passion. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
