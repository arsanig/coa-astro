<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How to keep one’s self pure in this sinful world?</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; One God, Amen. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is </span><span data-contrast="auto">generally </span><span data-contrast="auto">no easy task to be a </span><span data-contrast="auto">Christian in this world. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And</span><span data-contrast="auto">, in this last decade</span><span data-contrast="auto">, it has become increasingly </span><span data-contrast="auto">more </span><span data-contrast="auto">difficult. Humanity </span><span data-contrast="auto">has been </span><span data-contrast="auto">giving in </span><span data-contrast="auto">to </span><span data-contrast="auto">oblivious ideas and </span><span data-contrast="auto">the morality level is </span><span data-contrast="auto">rapidly </span><span data-contrast="auto">declining</span><span data-contrast="auto"> causing many to stumble and giving in to their passions.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> As Christians, we are not surprised, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Scripture does warn us of this eventuality. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Matthew 24 says: </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">…because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span> <span data-contrast="auto">But the question becomes </span><span data-contrast="auto">how do we, as Christians, deal with this? </span><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, we can always consider </span><span data-contrast="auto">physically </span><span data-contrast="auto">renouncing the world and </span><span data-contrast="auto">detach</span><span data-contrast="auto">ing from it. B</span><span data-contrast="auto">ut </span><span data-contrast="auto">the reality is we are not </span><span data-contrast="auto">monks </span><span data-contrast="auto">or </span><span data-contrast="auto">nuns or missionaries </span><span data-contrast="auto">in unaffected areas. </span><span data-contrast="auto">In fact, </span><span data-contrast="auto">we have </span><span data-contrast="auto">to deal </span><span data-contrast="auto">with the world and its darkness </span><span data-contrast="auto">on a daily bas</span><span data-contrast="auto">is. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So, </span><span data-contrast="auto">h</span><span data-contrast="auto">ow to keep one’s self pure in this sinful world?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In His prayer to the Father, in John 17, Christ pray</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span> <span data-contrast="auto">for</span><span data-contrast="auto"> His disciples not to be taken out of the world </span><span data-contrast="auto">but to be kept from the evil one. A few verses later, Christ prays</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the </span><span data-contrast="auto">following</span><span data-contrast="auto">: “I do not pray for these alone</span><span data-contrast="auto">, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word.”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I </span><span data-contrast="auto">personally </span><span data-contrast="auto">think this </span><span data-contrast="auto">prayer is</span> <span data-contrast="auto">particularly</span> <span data-contrast="auto">encouraging—the realization that Christ prayed to the Father for my personal salvation and yours.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">But Christ also warned us to watch! At the end of </span><span data-contrast="auto">His apocalyptic </span><span data-contrast="auto">message</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in Mark 13</span><span data-contrast="auto">, after describing the difficult events that will take place, He says: </span><span data-contrast="auto">“And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!”</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Be alert. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Like someone guarding a great treasure </span><span data-contrast="auto">in the middle of the night. </span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">he message is </span><span data-contrast="auto">protect </span><span data-contrast="auto">your soul from evil</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at all costs</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Therefore, b</span><span data-contrast="auto">eing watchful </span><span data-contrast="auto">stands</span><span data-contrast="auto"> in direct opposition to the </span><span data-contrast="auto">mindset</span> <span data-contrast="auto">some have of </span><span data-contrast="auto">fulfilling</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the </span><span data-contrast="auto">bare </span><span data-contrast="auto">minimum </span><span data-contrast="auto">and hope for the best</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">This attitude is problematic because </span><span data-contrast="auto">he who aims for 60% </span><span data-contrast="auto">in an exam </span><span data-contrast="auto">usually doesn’t </span><span data-contrast="auto">pass—spe</span><span data-contrast="auto">cially in this day and age. </span><span data-contrast="auto">But </span><span data-contrast="auto">more significantly, </span><span data-contrast="auto">this attitude strikes at </span><span data-contrast="auto">Christianity’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">core </span><span data-contrast="auto">objective</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span> <span data-contrast="auto">which is to be united with God. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Therefore, we ought to be watchful.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> We ought to aim for 100%.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Thus, </span><span data-contrast="auto">St. Peter warns us. He says: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span> <span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he way to deal with the </span><span data-contrast="auto">adversary is to be sober, vigilant, awake, </span><span data-contrast="auto">alert—what the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Church </span><span data-contrast="auto">fathers call </span><span data-contrast="auto">nepsis</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Even </span><span data-contrast="auto">t</span><span data-contrast="auto">hough,</span> <span data-contrast="auto">we </span><span data-contrast="auto">live in the world, we ought to </span><span data-contrast="auto">be alert</span><span data-contrast="auto"> t</span><span data-contrast="auto">o ensure </span><span data-contrast="auto">the world does not live within us. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We must remain sojourners </span><span data-contrast="auto">and </span><span data-contrast="auto">pilgrims</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">A good example of someone that remained </span><span data-contrast="auto">righteous even in the midst of an extremely dark environment is Lot, Abraham’s nephew. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Lot knew that the people of Sodom were </span><span data-contrast="auto">very </span><span data-contrast="auto">lustful </span><span data-contrast="auto">so </span><span data-contrast="auto">he kept watch at the city’s gate, even during the evening, to ensure that any </span><span data-contrast="auto">visitors will be protected </span><span data-contrast="auto">under the shelter of</span><span data-contrast="auto"> his home. </span><span data-contrast="auto">He</span><span data-contrast="auto"> also</span> <span data-contrast="auto">proved to be</span><span data-contrast="auto"> great</span><span data-contrast="auto">ly</span> <span data-contrast="auto">hospitab</span><span data-contrast="auto">le</span><span data-contrast="auto">. He was </span><span data-contrast="auto">truly </span><span data-contrast="auto">a </span><span data-contrast="auto">virtuous</span><span data-contrast="auto"> man</span><span data-contrast="auto"> even </span><span data-contrast="auto">in the midst of that darkness</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Evidently, </span><span data-contrast="auto">achieving </span><span data-contrast="auto">this is far from being easy</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We often fall but we need to get back up</span> <span data-contrast="auto">straightaway</span> <span data-contrast="auto">to </span><span data-contrast="auto">Christ</span><span data-contrast="auto"> who is our Hope</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">At the end of the video, I’ll share with you a very beautiful story </span><span data-contrast="auto">of repentance</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that is worth sticking around for</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Being watchful</span> <span data-contrast="auto">involves</span> <span data-contrast="auto">examining</span> <span data-contrast="auto">our</span><span data-contrast="auto"> thoughts. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Are they</span><span data-contrast="auto"> from Christ? </span><span data-contrast="auto">Or from an evil source</span><span data-contrast="auto">?</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Why did I arrive at </span><span data-contrast="auto">this</span> <span data-contrast="auto">specific </span><span data-contrast="auto">conclusion</span><span data-contrast="auto">? </span><span data-contrast="auto">Wa</span><span data-contrast="auto">s it to satisfy my ego?</span> <span data-contrast="auto">We ought to be on top of these thoughts</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and cast them out</span><span data-contrast="auto"> when needed</span><span data-contrast="auto">. But watchfulness alone is not the full story. In Matthew 26, Christ adds to watchfulness prayer</span><span data-contrast="auto">, He says</span><span data-contrast="auto">: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">.”</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Tito </span><span data-contrast="auto">Colliander</span><span data-contrast="auto">, in his book the way of the ascetics, gives </span><span data-contrast="auto">a beautiful </span><span data-contrast="auto">example</span><span data-contrast="auto"> about watchfulness and prayer</span><span data-contrast="auto">. He says</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the following</span><span data-contrast="auto">:</span><span data-contrast="auto"> “</span><span data-contrast="auto">In the middle of his </span><span data-contrast="auto">[the spider’s] </span><span data-contrast="auto">web he</span><span data-contrast="auto"> [the spider]</span><span data-contrast="auto"> sits and feels the smallest fly and kills it. Likewise prayer watches in the middle of your heart: as soon as a trembling makes it known that an enemy is there, prayer kills it. To leave off praying is the same thing as deserting one’s post. The gate stands open for the ravaging hordes, and the treasures one has gathered are plundered. The plunderer does not need long to accomplish his work: anger, for example, can destroy everything in a single second.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span> <span data-contrast="auto">In other words, </span><span data-contrast="auto">if any bad </span><span data-contrast="auto">thought attempt</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to </span><span data-contrast="auto">infiltrat</span><span data-contrast="auto">e </span><span data-contrast="auto">into </span><span data-contrast="auto">our souls</span><span data-contrast="auto">, we </span><span data-contrast="auto">ought to </span><span data-contrast="auto">immediately cast </span><span data-contrast="auto">it</span><span data-contrast="auto"> out and </span><span data-contrast="auto">say the Jesus prayer or </span><span data-contrast="auto">offer </span><span data-contrast="auto">repentance in </span><span data-contrast="auto">prayer. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Another imagery used by the Desert Fathers </span><span data-contrast="auto">is to strike the serpent on the head before it enters. Once it is in</span><span data-contrast="auto">side</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">the situation </span><span data-contrast="auto">becomes </span><span data-contrast="auto">complex. Similarly, we ought to </span><span data-contrast="auto">avoid at all costs entertaining the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> evil</span><span data-contrast="auto"> thought. We </span><span data-contrast="auto">ought to </span><span data-contrast="auto">cast </span><span data-contrast="auto">it </span><span data-contrast="auto">out </span><span data-contrast="auto">as it </span><span data-contrast="auto">att</span><span data-contrast="auto">empts to enter. </span><span data-contrast="auto">And if it </span><span data-contrast="auto">already </span><span data-contrast="auto">did</span><span data-contrast="auto"> enter</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">it is not too late, with much zeal we ought </span><span data-contrast="auto">to reject it</span><span data-contrast="auto"> so it won’t progress and establish evil roots within. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also, t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he desert fathers have </span><span data-contrast="auto">given us a tool to keep watchful. That tool is the remembrance of death. </span><span data-contrast="auto">The idea of having Christ always before us, knowing it is a matter of time </span><span data-contrast="auto">before we find ourselves in His Presence. This tool leads to watchfulness and repentance. St. Isaac the Syrian </span><span data-contrast="auto">poetically</span> <span data-contrast="auto">expounds this idea. He says: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">When you approach your bed, say to it: </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">This very night, perchance, you will be my tomb, O</span> <span data-contrast="auto">bed; for I know not whether tonight, in place of a transient sleep, the eternal sleep of the future</span> <span data-contrast="auto">will be mine.</span><span data-contrast="auto">’ </span><span data-contrast="auto">And so, while you still have legs, follow the path of doing</span> <span data-contrast="auto">[</span><span data-contrast="auto">good deeds</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto">]</span><span data-contrast="auto"> before you are tied by</span> <span data-contrast="auto">bonds that can never be severed. While you still have hands, crucify yourself in prayer before</span> <span data-contrast="auto">death comes. While you still have eyes, fill them with tears, before they are covered by dust</span><span data-contrast="auto">…</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Establish, O man, in your heart the thought that instant departure</span> <span data-contrast="auto">confronts you, and constantly say to yourself: </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">There, already, at the door is the messenger come for me. Why am I idle? My removal is forever; there will be no return.</span><span data-contrast="auto">’”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Again, this watchfulness business is far from being easy. We often fall. And when we do, our immediate reaction should be to get back up. So, f</span><span data-contrast="auto">inally, </span><span data-contrast="auto">I</span><span data-contrast="auto"> would like to </span><span data-contrast="auto">share with you this</span> <span data-contrast="auto">beautiful story of </span><span data-contrast="auto">repentance intertwined with </span><span data-contrast="auto">watchfulness</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="auto">prayer. It goes </span><span data-contrast="auto">like this: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">A brother who was dwelling in the monastery fell [in sin] repeatedly due to the intensity of warfare. He kept forcing himself to be patient in order not to abandon the monastic </span><span data-contrast="auto">skema</span><span data-contrast="auto">. He was diligent in his monastic life and said his prayers carefully. And in his prayer he would say: </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">Oh Lord, You see the severity of my state and my deep sorrow. Rescue me, O Lord, whether I am willing or unwilling, because I am like clay and I yearn for and love sin</span><span data-contrast="auto">…But you are the Great God, remove impurity from me, because if You only have mercy on Saints, this will not be strange. And if You only save the pure ones, then what will be the benefit, for they are already worthy. However, reveal the wonder of Your mercy in me, the unworthy, O my Lord, because I have submitted myself to You.’ This is the prayer he said every day, whether he committed a fault or not. One day, as he prayed fervently, Satan became weary of the boldness of his great hope, and as he chanted his psalms, a face appeared to him, saying:</span> <span data-contrast="auto">…‘Do you not feel ashamed of standing before God and mentioning His Name with your impure mouth?’ The brother responded: ‘Do you not strike with a sledgehammer and I do likewise? You cause me to fall into sin, and I ask the Merciful God to take pity on me. I struggle against you, until I am overtaken by death. I will cling onto hope from my God and I will not cease from being prepared for your attacks, and thus you will witness who wins: you or God's mercy. When the devil heard his words, he said: from now on, I will not fight you, lest I give you crowns because of your hope in your God. From that day, the devil kept away from him.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
